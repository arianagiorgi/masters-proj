Wooh also agreed to an order enjoining him from future violations.  Wooh's sentencing following his guilty plea was repeatedly delayed.  Finally, on October 14, 2011, the prosecutors filed a motion to drop its criminal information against Wooh, citing prosecutorial discretion.  It appears that the DOJ decided to dismiss following a protracted legal battle over how the case was handled and information from a FBI agent that Wooh was in fact a whistleblower in the case.  In December 2007, Robert W.

Patricia Green was also found guilty of falsely subscribing U.S. income tax returns in connection with the same set of conduct.  The conspiracy and substantive FCPA charges each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, while each of the money laundering charges carry a maximum penalty of up to twenty years in prison.  The false subscription of a U.S. income tax return charge carries a three-year maximum penalty and a fine not greater than USD 100,000.  In its 14 December 2009 response to the pre-sentence report for Gerald Green, the government argued that his sentencing range should be life in prison.  On 12 August 2010, the Greens were each sentenced to six months in prison followed by six months of home confinement and were each ordered to pay USD 250,000 in restitution.  After serving their six month terms, they were released from federal custody in May 2011.  The government initially appealed the short sentences but then withdrew the appeal on 23 August 2011.  The government did win a forfeiture count, leaving the Greens indigent.  The Greens appealed the restitution order of USD 250,000 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,  and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court ruling on 11 July 2013.

Under the plea agreement, KBR LLC agreed to pay a USD 402 million criminal fine and to retain an independent compliance monitor for a three-year period.  The Company also agreed to cooperate with the DOJ in its ongoing investigations.  It appears that Halliburton, KBR LLC's former parent company, will in fact pay all or most of the USD 402 million fine on behalf of KBR LLC, due to an indemnification agreement signed at the time of KBR LLC's separation from Halliburton in January 2009.  Also on 11 February 2009, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, KBR, Inc. and Halliburton consented to the entry of an order that (i) permanently enjoins KBR, Inc. from violating the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA, and from aiding and abetting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions; and (ii) permanently enjoins Halliburton from violating the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.  The two companies were also ordered to disgorge USD 177 million in ill-gotten profits.  An independent monitor was imposed on KBR, Inc. for a three-year period and Halliburton was required to retain an independent consultant to review its FCPA policies and procedures.  Halliburton and the KBR entities agreed to pay total penalties of USD 579 million to settle the DOJ and SEC enforcement actions.  Previously, on 3 September 2008, the DOJ filed criminal charges against KBR, Inc.'s former CEO, Albert ""Jack"" Stanley, for conspiring to violate the FCPA and conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud.  Stanley pleaded guilty to one count of each charge.  He faces a possible sentence of seven years in prison and payment of USD 10.8 million in restitution.  Stanley's sentencing was deferred until his cooperation with the DOJ in its ongoing investigation was complete.  He is currently awaiting sentencing.Also on 3 September 2008, the SEC charged Stanley with violations of the anti-bribery and books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in connection with his role in the bribery scheme.  Without admitted or denying the SEC's allegations, Stanley consented to the entry of a civil injunction and agreed to cooperate in the SEC's ongoing investigation.   On 17 February 2009, two UK nationals, Jeffrey Tesler and Wojciech Chodan, were indicted by a federal grand jury in Houston, Texas in connection with their participation in the bribery scheme.  Tesler, a London lawyer, was allegedly one of the agents hired by the four-company joint venture to funnel bribes to high-ranking Nigerian government officials.  Chodan was a former executive and consultant of a KBR, Inc.'s UK subsidiary.  The indictment was unsealed on 5 March 2009 in connection with the U.S. government's extradition request and charged Tesler and Chodan with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and ten substantive counts.  On 25 March 2010, District Judge Caroline Tubbs decided at Westminster Magistrates' Court that Tesler be extradited to the United States to stand trial. He had argued that the extradition request should be denied because he would no longer be able to receive a fair trial in the United States.  Tesler appealed the decision, but on 20 January 2011, the UK High Court ruled that it could go forward.   Tesler was formally extradited on 10 March 2011.  On 11 March 2011, Tesler pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Houston to one count of conspiracy and one count of violating the FCPA. As part of his plea agreement, Tesler agreed to forfeit USD 148,964,568.  At his sentencing, he faces faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on the conspiracy charge, and five years in prison on the FCPA violation charge. On 20 April 2010, Judge Tubbs ruled that Chodan be extradited to the U.S.  On 6 December 2010, following his extradition to the United States, Wojciech Chodan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  At his sentencing, Chodan faces a maximum penalty of 60 months in prison.  As part of his plea agreement, he agreed to forfeit USD 726,885.On 23 October 2009, Halliburton disclosed in an SEC filing that the UK's Serious Fraud Office (""SFO"") may bring civil claims or criminal charges against it under various UK laws.  According to Halliburton, the SFO is focused on the role of M.W. Kellogg Limited (""MWKL""), a UK subsidiary of KBR, in the TSKJ joint venture.  Halliburton also said it understood that the Bonny Island project is under investigation in France, Nigeria, and Switzerland as well, and could also result in third-party claims.The press reported that Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (""EFCC"") had arrested ten Halliburton employees in Nigeria during a raid of the offices of Halliburton Energy Services Nigeria Limited in Lagos on 25 November 2010.   The EFCC also arrested one employee each from Saipem Contracting Nigeria and Technip Offshore Nigeria.  On 7 December 2010, the EFCC reportedly filed corruption charges against Halliburton, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney (who was the CEO of Halliburton during the period at issue), Albert Stanley (former CEO of KBR), David Lesar (current CEO of Halliburton) and William Utt (current CEO of KBR).  Technip, Snamprogetti and JGC Corp. were reportedly also charged on the same day.  The case number is Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Halliburton and others, CV/435/10, High Court of Justice, Abuja Judicial Division (Abuja).On 21 December 2010, Halliburton reported that it reached a settlement with the Nigerian government, agreeing to pay a USD 32.5 million penalty and USD 2.5 million in legal expenses (the amount is significantly less than the supposed USD 120 million fine reported in the press previously).  Halliburton also agreed to assist the Nigerian government in recovering frozen assets in Switzerland.  In exchange, Nigeria agreed to withdraw all lawsuits and charges against KBR and Halliburton corporate entities and associated persons.  According to press reports, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker assisted with the settlement negotiations.  Former Vice President Dick Cheney had been charged by the Nigerian authorities as a former Halliburton executive.   On 20 December 2010, Saipem announced that Snamprogetti had entered into a settlement agreement and non-prosecution agreement with the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the investigation.  Snamprogetti agreed to the payment of a criminal penalty of USD 30 million, along with USD 2.5 million in reimbursement for legal costs and expenses incurred by the Nigerian authorities.  Nigeria agreed to dismiss all charges against Snamprogetti and to renounce to any civil claims and criminal charges in any jurisdiction.On 16 February 2011, following a High Court Order issued under Part 5 of the UK's Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002, the SFO announced a civil settlement in which MWKL will pay approximately GBP 7 million in recognition of funds MWKL was due to receive.  The SFO recognized that MWKL took no part in the criminal activity which generated the funds, but rather was used by its parent company, which participated in the joint venture and bribery scheme to bid for contracts on Bonny Island.  The agreement follows MWKL's self-reporting to the SFO in October 2009 and will lead to payment within fourteen (14) days in full and final settlement of the case.  The agreement also insures MWKL will pay the costs of the investigation, and MWKL will overhaul its internal audit and control measures to ensure its compliance systems are in accordance with UK law.  On 22 February 2012, Wojciech Chodan was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Chodan was also fined USD 20,000.  He had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges under the FCPA in December 2010, and could have received up to five years in prison.  Chodan's probation allows him to return to his residence in the UK.  The following day, on 23 February 2012, the judge in the case sentenced Jeffrey Tesler, a lawyer and consultant based in the UK who also pleaded guilty last year to violating the FCPA, to twenty-one months in prison, and two additional years of supervised probation.  Mr. Tesler had already agreed to forfeit approximately USD 150 million held in Swiss and Israeli bank accounts, at the time of the original plea agreement in March 2011 (this was the largest individual forfeiture to-date under the FCPA). In November 2012, a French court investigating Mr. Tesler's activity agreed to postpone a hearing in the case for one year, until 11 December 2013, after Tesler's scheduled release from jail in October 2013.Albert ""Jack"" Stanley, who pleaded guilty in 2008, was sentenced by Judge Keith B. Ellison to thirty months in prison, followed by three years of supervised probation, on 23 February 2012.  When he pleaded guilty in 2008, Stanley was ordered to pay USD 10.8 million in restitution for the kickbacks he admitted to having taken.  The judge in the case, Keith B. Ellison, agreed to allow Stanley to pay the USD 1.55 million remaining in USD 1,000 monthly installments following his release from prison.  Stanley is 69 years old in 2012. In its SEC Form 8-K filed on 19 July 2012, Halliburton announced that earlier in the month, on 9 July, the 165th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas had issued an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement of a derivative suit filed against Halliburton by some of its shareholders.  The derivative action had been filed in 2009 against current and former Halliburton directors and officers for violations of the FCPA while KBR, Inc. was working as a government contractor in Iraq, illegal kickbacks, fraud in government contracts, and prohibited activity in Iran. The proposed settlement was signed by the parties in June.  In it, the Company expressly denies wrongdoing by it or the individual officers and directors named, and requires that the settlement not be construed as an admission by any of the defendants.  The settlement provides for mandatory FCPA and UK Bribery Act training, revisions to the Company's code of business conduct, clawbacks against the officers and directors, limitations on discretionary payments to officers and the payment of legal expenses, and ongoing review and modifications of the compliance program and code of business conduct.In its 10-K Form submitted to the SEC on 20 February 2013, KBR, Inc. reported that its independent compliance monitor has ""certified that KBR's current anti-corruption compliance program is appropriately designed and implemented to ensure compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws.""On 20 May 2014, lawyer Jeffrey Tesler was disbarred by the UK Solicitors Regulation Authority.",A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,AS9E0S6DBSWH7,Yes,Yes,Yes,2015-04-17 04:06:35 UTC,,Yes3IZVJEBJ6AKXG2D6EERMINPA21SZ6W,16,"On 30 July 2009 H&P; settled with the DOJ, entering into a two-year non-prosecution agreement and agreeing to pay a USD 1 million penalty.

He also admitted to providing false information to both internal and external auditors during a 2004 audit. On 9 January 2009, Mario Covino, CCI's former Director of Worldwide Factory Sales, pleaded guilty to violating the FCPA and providing false and misleading information to both internal and external auditors during a 2004 audit. Covino, an Italian citizen, admitted to causing CCI employees to pay over USD 1 million in bribes to employees of state-owned customers.  On 8 April 2009, six former CCI executives were indicted for violating the FCPA and the Travel Act. The individuals include: (i) Stuart Carson, former CCI CEO, charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act and two counts of violating the FCPA; (ii) Hong Carson (also known as Rose Carson), former director of sales for China and Taiwan, charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act, five counts of violating the FCPA and one count of destruction on records related to an investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice; (iii) Paul Cosgrove, former director of worldwide sales, charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act, six counts of violating the FCPA and one count of violating the Travel Act; (iv) David Edmonds, former vice president of worldwide customer service, charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act, two counts of violating the FCPA and two counts of violating the Travel Act; (v) Flavio Ricotti, former vice president and head of sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act, one count of violating the FCPA and three counts of violating the Travel Act; and (vi) Han Yong Kim, former president of CCI's Korean operations, charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act and two counts of violating the FCPA.  On 8 December 2009, the Court denied two motions filed by the six former CCI executives: (1) The first Order denied Defendant's Motion for Discovery of documents pertaining to the plea agreement between CCI and the DOJ, in an attempt to circumvent seeking to obtain discovery through CCI.  The Defendants argued that the DOJ had ""constructive possession"" of CCI's internal investigation materials and it should therefore be considered discoverable, citing to U.S. v. Stein.  In the Stein case â€“ in which KPMG, the defendant, entered into a plea agreement with the DOJ while the DOJ was still prosecuting the individuals involved â€“ the Court had allowed for the discovery of materials disclosed by KPMG under its plea agreement.  In the CCI matter, the Court denied this motion, distinguishing it from Stein on the grounds that, unlike KPMG's plea agreement, CCI's agreement contained ""comprehensive privilege strictures.""  The Court also found that, unlike the request in Stein, the CCI defendants' request was too broad, including requests for electronic databases and attorney work-product material. (2) The second Order denied the Defendants' Motion for Dismissal of Counts 9-11 of the indictment, claiming certain DOJ requests for foreign records were outside of the Statute of Limitations for the specific counts and that the tolling provision did not apply to the indictment as a whole.  The Court denied the second motion, finding that the tolling provision did apply, as the tolling statute provides that the starting point for tolling the limitations period is the official request for evidence, not the date the motion is made or granted. Additionally, the Court stated that the tolling applies to the entire grand jury investigation as a whole, and is not count-specific.  The Court also struck down later motions by the defendants to dismiss the Travel Act charges on the basis that the law, along with the California Penal Code, could not be used to prosecute commercial bribery committed abroad. Flavio Ricotti was arrested on 14 February 2010, in Frankfurt, Germany, and was extradited to the United States, arriving on 2 July 2010.  He pleaded guilty on 29 April 2011 to a one-count superseding information charging him with conspiring to make corrupt payments to foreign government officials, and officers and employees of private companies in several countries, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in violation of the FCPA and the Travel Act.On 5 March 2012, Cosgrove and Edmonds  and Hong Carson filed both a motion to suppress and a motion to dismiss the charges against them.  The motion to dismiss turned on three claims:  that the defendants were denied access to key defense documents due to the ""partnership"" between the government (through the DOJ) and CCI (through its attorneys), in that they coordinated between themselves, conveyed information about the defendants' willingness to cooperate and even waived the attorney-client privilege, and disclosed otherwise privileged documents; the defendants' inability to access foreign third-party records and witnesses, and; that the FCPA and Travel Acts lack clarity and can therefore not form the basis of a criminal conviction of the defendants.  Regarding this third claim, the defendants hint that the payments may not have been made to foreign officials within the meaning of the FCPA, because the government has not defined the term ""instrumentality"" and has not explicitly stated that a state-owned enterprise is in fact an instrumentality of a foreign government.  In conclusion, the defendants claimed that the cumulative effect of these deficiencies is to prejudice the process irreparably.The defendants' 5 March 2012 motion to suppress was based on the claim ""that CCI and its counsel  were de facto public actors when they implicitly threatened to terminate Defendants' employment if they did not cooperate and participate in interviews with CCI's investigators.""  In their brief on the motion, the defendants explain that they were compelled to take part in interviews by CCI's counsel at a time when CCI was collaborating closely with the DOJ.  Because CCI's representatives were acting with the government's knowledge and ""with the government's general encouragement . . . CCI was an agent of the government during the interviews,"" and that ""[b]ecause CCI was a state actor when it compelled the Defendants' statements, it violated their Fifth Amendment rights and the statements must be suppressed."" On 14 May 2012, Judge David Selna of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division, issued a tentative order denying the motion to dismiss, stating that the cumulative effect of the shortcomings indicated by the defendants was insufficient to dismiss the claims against them.  On 17 May 2012, the judge also issued a tentative order denying  the motion to suppress, noting that ""[c]ooperation with the Government does not convert the party into a state actor,"" and concluding that the defendants' Fifth Amendment rights had not been violated by the conduct of the investigation. On 17 April 2012, Stuart Carson and his wife Hong Rose Carson pleaded guilty to separate one-count superseding informations describing FCPA violations.  In a court filing on 12 October 2012, prosecutors acknowledged the truth in Hong ""Rose"" Carson's pleading, in which her attorneys claimed that she deserved a lighter sentence (than the three years' probation to which she could be sentenced), given her background (she was born and raised in China until age 26), noting, ""The government cannot disagree that [the defendant]. . . lacked the American education and early business training of her co-defendants.""  Prosecutors  recommended a sentence of three years' probation, possibly including six months of home confinement, plus a fine of USD 20,000 for Rose Carson.  On 9 November 2012, Rose Carson was sentenced to 6 months home confinement, and ordered to pay a fine of USD 20,000, and to perform 200 hours of community service.  Her husband, Stuart Carson, who could have been sentenced to ten months in prison, received a sentence of 4 months imprisonment and a fine of USD 200,000.On 24 May 2012, Paul Cosgrove requested a hearing in order to change his previous plea of not guilty to guilty, and on 29 May Cosgrove pleaded guilty to a one-count superseding information charging him with making a corrupt payment to a foreign government official in China in violation of the FCPA.  Cosgrove was sentenced in September 2012 to 13 months home confinement and fined USD 20,000 for bribing Chinese officials. On 15 June 2012, David Edmonds pleaded guilty to a one-count superseding information charging him with making a corrupt payment to a foreign government official in Greece in violation of the FCPA.  On 17 December 2012, Edmonds was sentenced to 4 months in prison followed by 4 months of home confinement.  The maximum sentence he might have received was 15 months in prison. On 1 February 2013, prosecutors recommended that Ricotti, Covino and Morlok be sentenced to probation and/or time served in recognition of their cooperation with the DOJ investigation into CCI.  Main Justice reported that, on 11 March 2013, Morlok and Covino were sentenced to three years of probation in addition to three months of home confinement, while Ricotti was sentenced on 18 March 2013 to time served.

The authorities also requested a remand for Veijo Varis , a member of the management team of Patria.  Wiitakorpi  denied any wrongdoing, and Patria's internal investigation found no indication of illegal action.  Wiitakorpi, however, had to leave Patria in August 2008, although he remained in the employ of Patria in an advisory capacity.  According to press reports, on 23 June 2010 the Finnish Prosecutor-General's office announced that it was charging four Patria executives, as well as one Egyptian citizen, with aggravated bribery and accounting fraud in connection with alleged bribes paid to Egyptian officials.  Charges were also brought against Patria.According to press reports, in June 2011, the Pirkanmaa District Court found the four current or former Patria employees guilty of a number of counts of accounting fraud and complicity in those offenses, sentencing them to suspended prison terms.  Both the prosecutor and defendants are appealing to the Court of Appeal.  The prosecutor reportedly argues that the men should have been convicted of aggravated bribery and sentenced to tougher terms.  Patria itself reportedly was not found guilty of any wrongdoing; however, the company is appealing against legal costs incurred.In a press release on 18 December 2012, the Finnish Office of the Prosecutor General announced that the Finnish Prosecution Service had brought charges of aggravated bribery and business espionage against the former CEOs of Patria Oyj and Patria Vehicles Oy, and four employees of the Patria Group in connection with the sale of Patria AMV armored vehicles to Slovenia in 2006.According to a Reuters report from 28 June 2013, Finnish prosecutors announced that they would charge three unnamed former Patria executives with bribery of Croatian officials.

In a letter to the Audit Committees counsel, dated 27 February 2009, the DOJ requested that the Audit Committee pursue all reasonable avenues of investigation prior to completing the internal investigation and issuing a final report, recognizing that this may lead to a delay in the completion of the report.  The DOJ also requested that the Audit Committee not release the final report without the approval of the DOJ, given the possible interference with the DOJ's own investigation.  In the 27 February 2009 letter, the DOJ also stated that the company's assistance to the DOJ would be taken into account when the DOJ establishes its position on this matter.  On 29 December 2011, Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom AG agreed to pay a combined USD 95 million to settle civil and criminal charges to resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations into activities by Magyar Telekom and subsidiaries in Macedonia and Montenegro. The combined criminal penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) was USD 63.9 million, while Magyar Telekom agreed to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) charges by paying more than USD 31.2 million in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest settlement.  The DOJ filed a criminal information against Magyar Telekom and a two-year deferred prosecution agreement in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The SEC also sued three former Magyar executives. Also on 29 December 2011, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Elek Straub, Andras Balogh and Tamas Morvai, alleging that they had engaged in bribery schemes that resulted in the payment of  EUR 4.875 million, and EUR 7.35 million, part of which was paid as bribes to Macedonian and Montenegrin officials, respectively.In five claims including FCPA bribery offenses, books and records offenses, false accounting, internal controls and false statements, the SEC complaint requests injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties.On 29 October 2012, the defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  The grounds for the requested dismissal were (1) lack of personal jurisdiction; (2) barred by the statute of limitations; (3) failure to adequately state a bribery offense or other claim upon which relief may be granted.  In a 5 December 2012  memorandum in opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, the SEC claims that the defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction because their conduct caused foreseeable consequences in the United States; that the statute of limitations only begins to run when the defendants enter the United States, which they have yet to do, and; the complaint identifies specific acts which fall within the purview of the claimed violations.  Responding to this memorandum, the defendants claim that the SEC ignored key documents that undermined its arguments, including the fact that the annual filing for 2005 was not filed by the company, but instead postponed, and a disclosure informed investors that the company would release the results when the internal investigation was complete.  On 8 February 2013, Judge Richard J. Sullivan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the defendants' motion to dismiss in its entirety. Regarding the lack of personal jurisdiction claim, Judge Sullivan found that the SEC had established that Magyar Telekom's alleged bribes and concealment, even if occurring outside of the United States, were allegedly directed at the United States and thus were sufficient to meet the ""minimum contacts"" standard for personal jurisdiction in a U.S. district court. Judge Sullivan also found that the SEC sufficiently established the second part of the personal jurisdiction standard, which is that the court's exercise of jurisdiction over the defendants would not be unreasonable. Regarding the claim that the SEC's action was time barred, Judge Sullivan found in the plain language of the relevant statute that the five-year statute of limitations only begins when a defendant is ""found within the United States."" Over five years passed between the alleged conduct and the filing of the action, but the defendants were never ""found within the United States"" during this period. Therefore, the statute of limitations had not run. Finally, Judge Sullivan also rejected the defendants' three-tiered argument that the SEC's action failed to state a claim by not providing sufficient facts to support the allegations. Judge Sullivan found that the SEC provided sufficient facts to support 1) its claim that the defendants had made ""use of the mails or any other means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of"" the alleged bribes; 2) its claim that the intended recipients of the alleged bribes were ""foreign officials"" under the FCPA; and 3) its claim regarding the alleged fraudulent behavior of each defendant in reference to the Exchange Act's rule on materially false or misleading statements in SEC filings and audits. The judge therefore denied the motion to dismiss in its entirety and ordered a status conference for April 2013.On 26 February 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported that these defendants have requested permission from Judge Sullivan to file an interlocutory appeal of his decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On 10 March 2014, the SEC announced that it was dropping allegations that former executives of the Hungarian unit of Deutsche Telekom (Mr. Straub,  Mr. Balogh and Mr. Morval) bribed officials in Montenegro.  The remaining allegations that the executives bribed government officials in Macedonia to block competition against Magyar are still pending. (According to Magyar Telekom's Second Half 2010 Results, the company faced ongoing investigations by the Macedonian, Montenegrin, Hungarian and U.S. governments.  The company cooperated with each government investigation.  At that time, the company stated that it had  incurred HUF 2.3 billion in expenses related to the investigation in 2010.) Montenegro EnforcementThe Supreme State Prosecutor of the Republic of Montenegro is investigating Cmogorski Telekom, the company's Montenegrin subsidiary, in connection with the contracts at issue in the internal investigation.

The Hungarian National Bureau of Investigation (""NBI"") is investigating ""alleged misappropriation of funds relating to payments made in connection with the Company's ongoing internal investigation and the possible misuse of personal data of employees in the context of the internal investigation.""Macedonia EnforcementThe Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Macedonia issued requests to Magyar Telekom's Macedonian subsidiaries for information and documents related to certain procurement and dividend payment activities.  Based on a 10 December 2008 press release on the Macedonian Ministry of Interior website, it appears that the Ministry's Organized Crime Department submitted files to the Basic Public Prosecution Office of Organized Crime and Corruption in Macedonia, proposing that criminal charges be brought against four individuals, including three former Magyar Telekom Group employees.  These individuals are alleged to have committed an act of abuse of office and authorizations while employed at Makedonski Telekom (a Magyar Telekom subsidiary in Macedonia) in connection with five consulting contracts with a company called Chaptex Holdings Ltd. during 2005-2006.  Germany EnforcementAccording to press reports on 3 September 2010, Deutsche Telekom's offices were raided by German authorities in connection with an investigation by the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office into the alleged misconduct in Macedonia and Montenegro.

Under the agreement, Latin Node agreed to pay a USD 2,000,000 criminal fine, a USD 400 special assessment and agreed to continue its cooperation with the government.  The DOJ noted that the USD 2,000,000 statutory maximum fine was appropriate in this case, rather than calculating the fine under the Alternative Fines Act, because of the impossibility of calculating the profits or losses under the contracts since eLandia had terminated them upon discovering the illegal payments.  The DOJ also noted eLandia's extraordinary cooperation with the investigation, including its prompt voluntary disclosure to the government and its significant remedial efforts.  In particular, the government noted that eLandia terminated those Latin Node employees who were responsible for the conduct and strengthened its own anti-bribery compliance program even though no eLandia employees were involved in the conduct.  The government also cited Latin Node's acceptance of responsibility for its conduct and the fact that Latin Node only existed as a shell company for purposes of entering into a plea agreement with the government.  On 20 December 2010, Jorge Granados, Latin Node's former chief executive officer, and Manuel Caceres, the former vice president of business development, were arrested and indicted for allegedly paying more than USD 500,000 in bribes to government officials in Honduras.  The 19-count indictment, which was initially returned by a federal grand jury in Miami on 14 December 2010 and was unsealed on 20 December 2010, charged the two men with criminal violations of the FCPA and international money laundering.   Caceres pleaded guilty on 18 May 2011 and Granados pleaded guilty on 19 May 2011.  On 7 September 2011, Granados was sentenced to 46 months in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised release.On 19 April 2012, Caceres was sentenced to 23 months in prison; he is scheduled to begin serving his sentence in a Florida prison in July 2012.On 17 December 2010, Manuel Salvoch, Latin Node's former chief financial officer, and Juan Pablo Vasquez, the chief commercial officer, were charged in a sealed criminal information with conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  Salvoch was arrested on 11 January 2011 and pleaded guilty on 12 January 2011.  He faces up to five years in prison and fine of USD 250,000 or more, and three years of supervised released.  Salvoch is serving as a cooperating witness for the DOJ.  Vasquez pleaded guilty on 21 January 2011.Salvoch was sentenced to 10 months of prison on 8 June 2012, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Vazquez  received three years of probation.In Honduras, the country's Supreme Court on 22 January 2013 acquitted Marcelo Chimirri, former managing director of Hondutel, of all charges of bribery, fraud and abuse of authority.

On January 21, 2011 Perez was sentenced to 24 months in prison, followed by two years of supervised release, and to forfeit $36,375.  He had faced a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of the greater of $250,000 or twice the gross gain. On May 15, 2009, Diaz pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and money laundering.  He admitted to receiving more than $1 million in bribe money from the telecommunication companies and then laundering the money for a former Haitian official.  On July 30, 2010, Diaz was sentenced to 57 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  He was also ordered to pay $73,824 in restitution and to forfeit $1,028,851.  Antoine was extradited from Haiti to the U.S. on December 12, 2009 and held in Miami on $1 million bail.  On March 12, 2010, Antoine pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy count.  He agreed to a forfeiture order of $1,580,771.  On June 2, 2010, Antoine was sentenced to 48 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  In addition to the agreed forfeiture amount, he was also ordered to pay $1,852,209 in restitution.  After cooperating with the government and testifying as a witness in two of the Haiti Teleco cases, Antoine's four year sentence was reduced to 18 months, on 29 May 2012, when he had already served 16 months of the original sentence.On February 19, 2010, Fourcand pleaded guilty to laundering money used to bribe former Haiti Teleco officials.  On May 5, 2010, he was sentenced to six months in prison.  As part of his guilty plea, he also agreed to forfeit $18,500.

A fine of $100 was levied.On July 20, 2011, Duperval, Grandison and Joseph entered pleas of not guilty in response to the July 13 superseding indictment. On August 4, 2011, a federal jury convicted Joel Esquenazi and Carlos Rodriguez, former executives of Terra Telecommunications Corp., on all counts for their roles in a scheme to bribe Haiti Teleco officials.  They were each convicted of one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, seven counts of FCPA violations, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and 12 counts of money laundering. The verdict was reached after five hours of jury deliberations, following a two-and-a-half-week trial.  On October 25, 2011, Esquenazi was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Rodriguez was sentenced to 84 months in prison.On 9 May 2012, both Esquenazi and Rodriguez appealed their guilty verdicts to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging ""whether the District Court erred as a matter of law in its jury instruction regarding what constitutes an â€œinstrumentalityâ€ù of a foreign government for purposes of construing the counts, including the money laundering counts, that were dependent upon the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (â€œFCPAâ€ù)"" (Rodriguez), and ""Whether the appellant] is entitled to an acquittal because employees of Haiti Teleco were not 'foreign officials' within the meaning of [the] FCPA simply because the National Bank of Haiti owned shares of Haiti Teleco and the Haitian government appoint board members and directors."" (Esquenazi).  On 8 February 2012, Patrick Joseph, former director general of Haiti Teleco, changed his initial not- guilty plea to guilty, entering an agreement with the Department of Justice in the hopes of a reduced sentence in exchange for cooperation with the government.  Joseph was sentenced on 6 July 2012 to one year and one day imprisonment to begin on 6 August 2012, plus a fine of USD 100, and one year of supervised release following release from prison, based on one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.   On 24 February 2012,  U.S. District Court Judge Jose Martinez granted the DOJ's motion to dismiss the case as against Cinergy, on the grounds that the government had determined the company to be ""a non-operational entity that exists only on paper for the benefit of two fugitive defendants, Washington Vasconez Cruz and Cecilia Zurita."" Jean Rene Duperval, former head of international relations at Haiti Teleco, was convicted on 12 March 2012 on all counts of conspiracy and money laundering for which he was tried.  This included two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and 19 counts of money laundering.  The DOJ statement announcing the conviction noted, â€œTo conceal the payment and receipt of bribes, Duperval participated in a money laundering scheme to funnel about half a million dollars to two shell companies under his control...This verdict confirms that American taxpayers will not tolerate bribery, either at home or abroad,  to obtain unfair business advantages.â€ù  Duperval testified in his own defense at trial, claiming that the payments were ""tokens of appreciation,"" not bribes.  Judge Martinez found Duperval guilty of perjury on the witness stand, and sentenced him 9 years in prison on 21 May 2012.  Duperval was also required to forfeit USD 497,331.On 16 May 2014, the 11th Circuit affirmed the DOJ's expansive view of a ""foreign official"" under the FCPA, upholding Joel Esquenazi and Carlos Rodriguez's convictions, and keeping intact the longest prison sentence ever imposed in an FCPA case.  A unanimous three-judge panel defined ""instrumentality"" as ""an entity controlled by the government of a foreign country that performs a function the controlling government treats as its own.""  On 14 August 2014, Mr. Esquenazi and Mr. Rodriguez petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review their convictions on FCPA-related charges and to determine whether ""an entity controlled by the government of a foreign country that performs a function the controlling government treats as its ownâ€ù (1) fails to satisfy the constitutional requirement of adequate notice of what specific conduct violates the FCPA, and (2) is erroneously derived from commentary to an unrelated treaty [the OECD anti-bribery convention] that postdates the FCPAâ€™s enactment.""The DOJ's investigation and proceedings against other companies and individuals involved in the scheme is ongoing.",A1012N48J0Z65N,Yes,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,Yes,Yes,2015-04-17 04:06:43 UTC,,Yes3V0TR1NRVA2I071KJYI84WENXPF4AF,39,"On 27 September 2007, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Immucor and De Chirico consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order.

The FSA investigation was settled at an early stage, allowing for a 30% discount.  But for Aon Limited's cooperation and prompt settlement, the financial penalty that would have been imposed by the FSA would have been GBP 7.5 million.  The FSA recognized that Aon Limited's senior management had taken steps to mitigate the seriousness of its failings.  Aon Limited had promptly reported the matter to SOCA and the FSA after discovering two groups of potentially improper payments.  On discovery of the third case Aon Limited had established a dedicated steering committee which reported directly to its Board and this committee had overall responsibility for reviewing both the inappropriate payments and the systems and controls related to intermediaries.  Aon Limited had instructed a leading firm of accountants to review its systems and controls in place to control the payments to intermediaries.  Aon Limited implemented the short recommendations made by the external accountants.  Aon Limited also retained its law firms to carry out detailed investigations of potentially inappropriate payments and, where appropriate, had taken responsive action including termination or other disciplinary action against staff.  Aon Limited, in conjunction with Aon Corporation, designed and implemented a global anti-corruption program described by the FSA as a ""model of best practices that other firms may wish to adopt.""  Contained within that program was a general prohibition on the use of intermediaries whose only service was to obtain and retain business solely through client introduction in countries where the risk of corrupt practices was anything other than low.  Both Aon Limited and Aon Corporation have implemented robust risk based procedures to review all its existing and proposed relationships with intermediaries.  Further, both Aon Limited and Aon Corporation have taken significant actions to ensure a clear anti-corruption compliance culture within the business.  Top-down management-led initiatives designed to ensure a significant change in the culture of the organization globally have been implemented.  Both Aon Limited and Aon Corporation have also strengthened their processes and controls in relation to the use of intermediaries, and implemented other elements of a best practices compliance program, including customized enhanced training.United StatesIn 2011, AON entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay a USD 1.76 million penalty to resolve violations of the FCPA (see below).

The Telegraph reported, however, on 22 November 2011 that the amount that the SFO would require Alstom to pay under a settlement would be higher than the EUR 31 million paid by the Company under its settlement with Swiss authorities.In June 2014, the Attorney General gave the SFO permission to prosecute Alstom and its former employees for alleged overseas bribery, and on 24 July 2014, the SFO started criminal proceedings against Alstom's UK subsidiary, charging it with three corruption offenses, and three counts of conspiracy to corrupt.  On 10 September 2014, the trial of a U.K. subsidiary of Alstom began, with the SFO alleging in filings that the company paid USD $8.5 million in bribes for large transportation contracts in India, Poland, and Tunisia. A former managing director at the industrial giant Alstom appeared in court on 27 October 2014 after he was accused of bribing Indian transport officials to win lucrative contracts.  Robert Hallett, who worked for the companyâ€™s UK business, was accused of paying agents of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation USD $3.82 million (Â£2.44 million) and 19.9 million rupees (USD $316,792) â€œas inducements or rewards for showing favor to the Alstom in relation to the award or performance of a contract.""Graham Hill, a former director of Alstom, was charged by a British court on 15 January 2015 with corruption and conspiring to dishonestly obtain services in relation to transportation contracts in India and Poland.  Two of the charges relate to Mr. Hill corruptly giving or agreeing to give payments to an official or officials or other agents of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited.  According to the allegations, Mr. Hill improperly gave ""the sum of INR 19,895,000 disguised as payments in respect of a Consultancy Agreement with Indo European Ventures Pte Ltd.""  Mr. Hill also allegedly gave ""the sum of 3,131,600 euros disguised as a payment in respect of a Consultancy Agreement with Global King Technology Ltd dated 3rd May 2002 as inducements or rewards for showing favour to the Alstom Group in relation to the award or performance of a contract with the said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd for a Train Control, Signalling and Telecommunications System for the Delhi Metro Phase 1.""  Mr. Hill's case was sent to Southwark Crown Court in London for a preliminary hearing on 28 January 2015.BRAZILDomestic bribery investigations in Brazil appear to be ongoing.  According to one press report on 2 March 2011, Brazil's Ministry of Justice received relevant documents from the Swiss and French authorities in early February 2011. According to news reports, in February 2015 a Brazilian court blocked approximately $104 million of assets belonging to Alstom, three former employees and a Sao Paulo judge.ITALYDomestic bribery investigations in Italy appear to be ongoing.  MEXICOAccording to a 2007 OECD report, in 2001 Mexican authorities brought civil charges against Alstom for bribing two high-ranking Mexican officials in 1999 in order to win a tender.  In 2004, Mexico's Ministry of Public Administration fined Alstom MXN 341,100 and barred the Company from participating in public tender procedures for two years. (Areva, another French company, was similarly charged and penalized in connection with the matter.)SLOVENIAAfter an investigation into the contract for the power plant in Sostanj, the Slovenia Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (SCPC) released its findings in February 2012, saying that ""there was (and still is) high risk of corruption and conflict of interest"" in the project. Reuters reported on 20 April 2012 that the Slovene Parliament voted to guarantee the loan provided for the project in spite of the SCPC's report of potential corruption. Aspects of Alstom's winning bid for the project appear to still be under investigation by the Slovenian National Investigations Office.SWITZERLANDOn 6 May 2010, Swiss prosecutors indicted Swiss banker Oskar Holenweger for money laundering and fraud in connection with his management of Alstom funds.  According to press reports, the indictment alleges that he received about CHF 1 million (USD 900,000) in exchange for arranging bribe payments from Alstom to business partners.  On 21 April 2011, it was reported that a Swiss court acquitted Holenweger of the charges and awarded him more than CHF 400,000 (USD 450,000) in damages, having found the evidence to be insufficient. On 22 November 2011, the Swiss Office of Attorney General (OAG) closed its investigation into Alstom.  Prosecutors identified three cases in which improper payments were made by Alstom Network Schweiz AG to civil servants in Latvia, Malaysia and Tunisia.  The Company was sanctioned for ""corporate negligence"" and fined CHF 2.5 million (around EUR 2 million), as well as  an amount corresponding to the estimated profits in the order of CHF 36 million (around EUR 29 million).  The OAG noted the Company's cooperation and remedial compliance measures. WORLD BANKOn 22 February 2012, a Negotiated Resolution Agreement was reached between Alstom and the World Bank.  This settlement includes (1) the debarment of Alstom Hydro France and Alstom Network Schweiz AG and their affiliates for a period of three years, and (2) payment of approximately USD 9.5 million in restitution by the two companies.  The period of debarment could be reduced to 21 months with enhanced oversight if all conditions are complied with.  Alstom SA and its affiliates are conditionally non-debarred.  However, Alstom Hydro France and Alstom Network Schweiz are subject to cross-debarment by other development banks.  The penalties are based on a finding that Alstom made an improper payment of a USD $145,000 (EUR 110,000) consultancy fee to an entity controlled by a former senior government official in Zambia in 2002.  Alstom did not admit the allegations.On 24 February 2015, Alstom disclosed that its subsidiaries Alstom Hydrom France, Alstom Network Schweiz and their affiliates had been released from the World Bank debarment based on the World Bank's Integrity Compliance Office's determination that Alstom had satisfied the conditions of its 21 February 2012 settlement with the World Bank. As part of its determination, the Integrity Compliance Office determined that Alstom had implemented a compliance program that is ""in line with the World Bank's integrity compliance guidelines.""EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK AND EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENTIn April 2012, media reports stated that the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) had initiated investigations into the leak of information during the 2007 bidding process. Prior to this announcement, on 16 March 2012, the EBRD suspended payments on the TES project, pending the conclusion of an investigation into bidding and procurement corruption.ANCILLARY CONSEQUENCES: INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORSIn December 2011, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance placed Alstom on the Norwegian Government Pension Fund's watch list because of the corruption allegations.

The (former) Swedish Chief Prosecutor stated, when commenting on the decision, that Swedish law does not effectively cover these types of arrangements between intermediaries and consultants.  The Swedish investigation was criticized for having had very limited resources.  It was formally closed in June 2009 but, in May 2011, it was reported that a new investigation had been opened into an aspect of the deal with the South African government.  Swedish news channel TV4 reported that Sanip, a Saab subsidiary, entered into a consulting contract in 2003 with an adviser to the South African Minister of Defense at the time.  Sanip allegedly paid  50 million Swedish kronor (USD 7.9 million) in 19 installments between 2003 and 2005, through the adviser, to Ministry of Defense officials in order to prevent the termination of the Gripen deal entered into in 1999.  On May 20, 2011, Saab issued a press release stating that it was conducting an internal investigation into the matter but that so far there was no indication that Saab had any knowledge or involvement in any wrongdoing.  Saab stated: ""At the time, Sanip was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saab in South Africa whose operations were being run by BAE Systems plc. In 2004, the operations were formally transferred from Sanip to BAE and the company has been dormant since then.""Czech RepublicThe Czech government opened an investigation into the Gripen fighter deal in 2002. The investigation was closed after the police determined that while the deal was most likely tainted with corruption, it could not find any evidence related to the individuals involved. The investigation was re-opened in 2007, but closed again in 2009 for the same reason. In March 2010, the Supreme State Attorney pushed for the police to re-open the investigation for a third time.  It is unclear for a time whether the investigation remained open. According to press reports on August 30, 2011, the Czech investigation remains open and recently received assistance from the SFO in the UK.  The SFO reportedly sent documents on August 8th related to the Czech attempt to buy the 24 JAS Gripen jet fighter planes.  The assistance was reportedly moved forward following Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas's decision to raise the issue with his British counterpart, David Cameron, when the latter visited Prague at the end of June.The Czech government has received information from the Polish and Austrian authorities but still awaits replies to its assistance requests to the US and Switzerland.HungaryIn June 2007 the Hungarian government set up an investigative committee to look into the Gripen affair. The report was completed in November 2007 and was not made fully public. The committee did not investigate the questions of corruption or political responsibility, and said that these will be the task of a parliamentary committee to be formed later.

He was indicted on 19 December 2006 on charges of violating the FCPA and money laundering.  A ten-count superseding indictment was handed down on March 20, 2007.  On 6 June 2007, Sapsizian pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the FCPA and one substantive FCPA violation.  He was sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years supervised release on 23 September 2008.  The court also ordered him to forfeit USD 261,500.  Sapsizian admitted that from February 2000 through September 2004, he conspired with Valverde and others to make millions of dollars in bribe payments to Costa Rican officials in order to obtain a telecommunications contract on behalf of Alcatel.  In its plea agreement with Sapsizian, the government agreed not to charge him with FCPA violations related to corrupt payments in other parts of Latin America. On 20 March 2007, Edgar Valverde Acosta, a Costa Rican citizen, was indicted for violating the FCPA.  He remains a fugitive.DOJ and SEC SettlementsOn 27 December 2010, the DOJ filed a criminal information in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida charging Alcatel with one count of violating the internal control provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA.  The DOJ and Alcatel agreed to resolve the charges by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement for a term of three years.  The DOJ also filed a criminal information charging three subsidiaries - Alcatel-Lucent France S.A. (formerly known as Alcatel CIT S.A.), Alcatel-Lucent Trade International A.G. (formerly known as Alcatel Standard A.G.) and Alcatel Centroamerica S.A. (formerly known as Alcatel de Costa Rica S.A.) - with conspiring to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions.  Each of the three subsidiaries agreed to plead guilty to the charges.  Alcatel and the three subsidiaries agreed to pay a combined USD 92 million criminal fine.  Alcatel also agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor (who is a French national) for a three year period.  The settlement and guilty pleas were finalized in Miami federal court on 1 June 2011. Also on 27 December 2010, the SEC filed a settled civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to resolve charges that Alcatel violated the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions.  Alcatel agreed to pay USD 45,372,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.French InvestigationThe French Investigating Magistrate (Tribunal de grande instance de Paris) appears to be continuing its investigation into the activities of Alcatel-Lucent France in Costa Rica, Kenya, Nigeria and French Polynesia.  Costa Rican InvestigationThe Public Prosecutor's Office in Costa Rica opened investigations into company employees as well as the government officials who were the recipients of the alleged bribes.  Alcatel reportedly made a USD 10 million payment in January 2010 to the Costa Rican government for ""societal damages,"" settling the government's case against the company.  On 27 April 2011, Former President Miguel Angel Rodriguez was convicted of accepting at least USD 800,000 in bribes from Alcatel and was sentenced to a five year prison term.  Eight other people charged along with the ex-president were reportedly convicted as well and sentenced to varying terms.In Alcatel-Lucent's SEC Form 6-K filed on 8 August 2012, the company added, ""ICE on May 3, 2012 filed before the Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo y Civil de Hacienda of Costa Rica a new claim against a number of Alcatel-Lucent legal entities with regards to the corruption matter that was investigated by and settled with the Costa Rican and United States authorities. The ICE claim totals 14 million euros. No reserves have been booked as it is Alcatel-Lucent's position that this matter has been fully settled with the Costa Rican Prosecution Office in 2010.""Malaysian InvestigationAccording to press reports on 25 March 2011, Malaysian authorities also began investigating Alcatel in December 2010 following the company's settlement with the U.S. government.  According to press reports on 19 July 2011, Radziah Ani - a former regional customer account leader for Alcatel Malaysia - was charged by Malaysian prosecutors under the Anti Corruption Act of 1997, with bribing a Telekom Malaysia assistant manager.  On 13 August 2012, the Court in Malaysia announced that the prima facie case against Radziah had been proved, and that she would now be required to enter her defense.  Radziah is accused of offering a RM 25,000 bribe to Telekom Malaysia Bhd assistant manager Mohd Asri Idris so that the latter would provide information about an ongoing tender at that time (2006) for the supply of Wideband Code Division Multiple Access Mobile Communications Systems.  The tender, which was ultimately awarded to Alcatel, was valued at RM 320 million (approx. USD 106 million). The offense is alleged to have been committed at the Shangri-la Hotel in Jalan Sultan Ismail on 17 February 2006.

Siemens Argentina pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and Siemens Venezuela and Siemens Bangladesh each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA.  Siemens was required to pay a USD 448.5 million criminal fine and Siemens Argentina, Bangladesh, and Venezuela were each required to pay a USD 500,000 criminal fine, bringing the total amount in criminal fines in the United States to USD 450 million. Siemens, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the Company from future violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions.  Siemens was also required to pay USD 350 million in disgorgement of profits. Both the DOJ and SEC noted Siemens' extraordinary cooperation during the investigation and the extensive remedial measures undertaken by the Company, including the scope of its internal investigation after disclosing the conduct to the U.S. enforcement authorities, disciplinary actions against individuals involved, and the restructuring of the Company's compliance program.On 9 January 2009, the DOJ announced that it had filed a forfeiture action against Siemens' accounts in Singapore held by multiple account holders.  The funds in the accounts were allegedly related to bribes paid by Siemens and China Harbor Engineering to Arafat ""Koko"" Raman, the son of Bangladesh's former prime minister in connection with the award of a public works project in Bangladesh.  The funds allegedly were paid in U.S. dollars and flowed through banks in the United States before being deposited into accounts in Singapore.   Individual ProsecutionsOn 13 December 2011, the DOJ charged eight former executives and agents of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries for allegedly engaging in a decade-long scheme to bribe senior government officials in Argentina to secure, implement, and enforce a USD 1 billion contract with the government of Argentina to produce national identity cards.  The defendants in the DOJ action, Uriel Sharef, Herbert Steffen, Andres Truppel, Ulrich Bock, Eberhard Reichert, Stephan Signer, Carlos Sergi, and Miguel Czysch, are not U.S. citizens and reside outside of the United States.  Unless the U.S. government obtains extradition of the men, they cannot be tried on the criminal charges.The SEC also filed a civil action on related charges against seven men, alleging that over USD $100 million in bribes were paid in connection with Siemens' efforts to secure the contract and obtain the profits from that contract. As for these charges, legal process requires that the defendants be served with the complaint in the lawsuit, but SEC lawyers were unable to serve the four German defendants (Sharef, Signer, Steffen, and Bock) via the Hague Convention, absent the cooperation of the German government, which responded to requests for assistance in service by stating:  ""The German government has recently advised that an action by the SEC seeking civil penalties for violations of U.S. federal securities laws is not, under German law, a 'civil or commercial matter' within the meaning of the Hague Convention."" Therefore, the SEC attorneys requested permission to serve the four men through newspaper notices and emails to their attorneys.  On 26 June 2012, the U.S. court agreed to this request. On 12 October 2012, Herbert Steffen filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to satisfy the statute of limitations. On 19 February 2013, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Steffen's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, saying that Steffen did not have sufficient contacts with the United States to meet the requirements of personal jurisdiction and that exercising jurisdiction over him would be unreasonable due to his age and other factors. Regendantz settled the SEC charges in December 2011 without admitting or denying the allegations by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from committing future violations. He paid a EUR 30,000 (USD $ 40,000) administrative fine ordered by the Munich prosecutor.The Wall Street Journal reported on 15 April 2013 that Uriel Sharef agreed to pay USD $275,000 to settle the SEC's civil suit against him. Sharef did so without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. On 4 February 2014, two former Siemens executives were ordered to pay a combined USD $1.46 million for their roles in a USD $1 billion Argentine government contract bribery scheme, the largest Foreign Corrupt Practices Act penalties ever levied against individuals.  U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin entered a default judgment against Mr. Signer and Mr. Bock and ordered each to to pay a USD $524,000 civil penalty and Mr. Block to pay an additional USD $413,957 for disgorgement. The two German nationals allegedly bribed Argentine government officials as part of a decade-long scheme to retain a USD $1 billion government contract to produce Argentine national identity cards.On 14 August 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by a former Siemens compliance officer in China who said the company retaliated against him after he internally reported alleged corrupt sales practices.  The court granted Siemensâ€™s motion to dismiss with prejudice, holding that the anti-retaliation provision of the Doddâ€êFrank Act (15 U.S.C. Â§ 78uâ€ê6(h)(1)) does not apply extraterritorially.ARGENTINAOn 14 December 2012, La Nueva reported that a federal judge in Argentina held a hearing regarding the possible extradition of former Siemens AG CFO Andres Truppel to the United States to face criminal charges. Main Justice reported on 18 March 2013 that Truppel is one of four defendants who also have failed to respond to the civil suit brought by the SEC, and that the SEC is seeking to have Truppel be considered in default of the civil charges. On 14 June 2011, it was reported that a Siemens management board member had been charged in connection with breach of trust in connection with bribes paid (through slush funds, phony companies and middlemen) in Argentina between 2003 and 2007. Argentinian authorities searched the offices of Siemens Argentina and Siemens IT Services S.A. in Buenos Aires in August 2008 and February 2009. The Argentinean investigative judge requested judicial assistance from the Munich public prosecutor and the federal court in New York.In a separate suit arising out of the earlier investigation, Carlos Moran, formerly a government investigator in Argentina, brought a claim in federal court in Miami against Siemens AG and Siemens' subsidiary in Argentina.  Moran claims that Siemens paid people to physically attack him after he blew the whistle on Siemens' bid for the national identity card project.CHINAShi Wanzhong, former chairman and general manager of China Mobile Anhui Province, was sentenced to death in May 2011 in the Intermediate Court of Hebei City, Henan Province, for receiving USD $5.1 million in bribes from Siemens.  Shi received a two-year reprieve (which usually means that the sentence will not be carried out).  The trial was closed to the public. Tian Qu, who served as sales agent for Siemens and was responsible for brokering the deals between Siemens and China Mobile Anhui and for transferring the kickbacks to Shi, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for facilitating Shi's corruption. The Chinese investigation appears to have concluded in June 2011. On 15 January 2013, a former compliance officer for Siemens' Chinese subsidiary filed a lawsuit against Siemens in federal court in New York.  The former employee, a Taiwanese man named Meng-Lin Liu, claimed that in May 2011, one week after presenting evidence of Siemens' continued internal controls violations and the Company's  circumvention of its plea agreement with U.S. authorities, he was notified that his contract would not be renewed, and that he should not report to work. In the complaint, Liu alleges that the evidence he submitted to the SEC and Siemens' executives revealed the Company's practice of submitting inflated bids for the sale of medical imaging equipment in China, and then selling the equipment at lower prices to intermediaries, for resale to public hospitals.GERMANYIn its settlement with the Munich Prosecutor's Office, Siemens (apart from its telecommunications group) pleaded guilty to charges related to a corporate failure to supervise its officers and employees and paid a total of EUR 395 million (approximately USD 569 million), including a EUR 250,000 corporate fine and EUR 394.75 million in disgorgement of profits.  In a related action, Siemens' telecommunications operating group settled charges with the Munich Prosecutor's Office in October 2007, and paid EUR 201 million in fines and penalties (approximately USD 287 million), including a EUR 1 million fine and EUR 200 million in disgorgement of profits. In addition to monetary fines and penalties, the German public prosecutors required Siemens to retain an independent compliance monitor for a four-year period.  Siemens and the enforcement agencies agreed to the appointment of Dr. Theodor Waigel, the former German finance minister, as its independent monitor.  Joseph Warrin of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP was appointed to serve as counsel to the monitor with respect to the requirements of the FCPA. On 20 April 2010, Michael Kutschenreuter, the former financial head of Siemens' telecommunications unit, was found guilty of breach of trust and abetting bribery in a Munich court.

GREECEAccording to press reports on 25 November 2011, Greek finance and justice ministers sought an out-of-court settlement with Siemens in the range of EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million.  In February 2012, Siemens entered into an agreement with the Greek government, pledging to forgo EUR 80 million in outstanding Greek debt in exchange for no claims for reparations resulting from the bribery scandal, which purportedly cost Greek taxpayers EUR 2 billion in overpayment of Siemens contracts.  All told, Greece owes Siemens approximately EUR 150 million.  The arrangement requires Greece to invest EUR 90 million with Siemens in new projects. In a press release on 5 April 2012, Siemens confirmed the arrangement, announcing that the Greek Parliament had ratified the settlement agreement.  The settlement approves Siemens' forgiving of EUR 80 million owed to it by the Greek government, for supplies delivered to Greek medical facilities over a period of years.  Siemens has agreed to spend up to EUR 90 million on ""transparency initiatives and anti-corruption programs,"" and on research.  Siemens also agreed to spend over EUR 100 million on its own commercial activities in Greece, thereby encouraging economic growth and increasing employment within Greece. According to media reports, on 9 March 2015 Greek authorities indicted 64 people to stand trial for bribery or money laundering. Former Siemens and OTE officials are included in those indicted.

The suspension applied to contracts with the UN Secretariat and stemmed from Siemens AG's guilty plea in December 2008 to violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. On December 22, 2009, Siemens AG filed a request to lift the existing suspension. Effective January 1, 2011, the UNPD lifted the suspension against Siemens AG.""Related Civil LitigationCompany suit against directors: Siemens AG asserted claims against former members of the Managing and Supervisory Board for breaches of organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices that occurred in the course of international business transactions in the years 2003 to 2006 and the resulting financial burdens for the Company. On December 2, 2009 Siemens reached a settlement with nine out of eleven former members of the Managing and Supervisory Board. The Company reached a settlement agreement with its directors and officers (D&O;) insurers regarding claims in connection with the D&O; insurance of up to â‚¬100 million, of which â‚¬84 million resulted from the settlement agreement with the D&O; insurers and â‚¬12 million resulted from settlement agreements with former board members. The former board members used claims they had against the Company to offset a portion of their obligations under the aforementioned settlement agreements. The remaining amount was or will be settled by the former board members in cash. On January 25, 2010, Siemens AG filed a lawsuit with the Munich District Court I against the two former board members who were not willing to settle, Thomas Ganswindt and Heinz-Joachim Neuburger. Derivative shareholder suit: An alleged holder of Siemens American Depositary Shares filed a derivative lawsuit in February 2007 with the Supreme Court of the State of New York against certain current and former members of Siemens' Managing and Supervisory Boards as well as against Siemens as a nominal defendant, seeking various forms of relief relating to the allegations of corruption and related violations at Siemens.

Argentinian arbitration:Siemens AG filed a request for arbitration against Argentina with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) of the World Bank. Siemens AG claimed that Argentina had unlawfully terminated its contract with Siemens for the development and operation of a system for the production of identity cards, border control, collection of data and voters' registers (DNI project) and thereby violated the Bilateral Investment Protection Treaty between Argentina and Germany (BIT). Siemens AG sought damages for expropriation and violation of the BIT of approximately U.S. $500 million. A unanimous decision on the merits was rendered by the ICSID arbitration tribunal on February 6, 2007, awarding Siemens AG compensation in the amount of U.S. $217.8 million, plus compound interest thereon at a rate of 2.66% since May 18, 2001. The tribunal also ruled that Argentina is obligated to indemnify Siemens AG against any claims of subcontractors in relation to the project (amounting to approximately U.S. $44 million) and, furthermore, that Argentina would be obligated to pay Siemens AG the full amount of the contract performance bond (U.S. $20 million) in the event this bond was not returned. The time period set by the tribunal for returning the contract performance bond subsequently elapsed without delivery. As previously reported, Argentina subsequently filed applications with the ICSID aiming at the annulment and reversal of the decision and a stay of enforcement of the arbitral award. On August 12, 2009, Argentina and Siemens AG reached an agreement to mutually settle the case and discontinue any and all civil proceedings in connection with the case without acknowledging any legal obligations or claims. No payment was made by either party.Civil Suit by Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A.: In July 2008, the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A.

Saybolt, Inc. was also required to implement and maintain an effective compliance program.  In addition, the company agreed to cooperate with the government in its ongoing investigation. On April 17, 1998, Frerik Pluimers and David Mead were indicted on charges of conspiring to violate the FCPA, substantive violations of the FCPA and violations of the Travel Act.  Mead stood trial and was convicted of the charges in October 1998.  He was sentenced to four months in jail, four months of home confinement, three year's supervised probation and was required to pay a $20,000 fine. During his trial, Mead raised the defense that he was acting on advice of counsel.  According to Mead, Philippe Schreiber, an attorney with New York-based Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green P.C. and a Director of Saybolt North America, advised during a Board meeting in November 1995 that the company would only be criminally liable for the bribe if it was paid by Saybolt North America.  Schreiber allegedly advised that the bribe could be paid legally by the Dutch entity, Saybolt International.  The jury instruction specifically stated that Mead could not be convicted if he believed that the transaction was legal.  The jury convicted Mead, rejecting his argument that he believed the transaction was legal.Pluimers, who was in the Netherlands when he was indicted, has not returned to the U.S. to stand trial.  The U.S. government requested the Netherlands to extradite him in 2000 but Dutch authorities have refused the request.  In March 2008, his attorney entered an appearance for an arraignment and guilty plea, but Pluimers never appeared in court.  He remains a fugitive and is on the EPA's most wanted list.

The offence must be committed for the benefit or interest of the legal person. There is no offence committed where the person responsible commits the offence exclusively in his/her own interest or in the interest of a third party.2. The offence must be committed by a person acting as a representative, director or manager (de facto), a person exercising powers of management and control or a person subject to the direction or control of one of the aforementioned persons.3. The offence must be committed through non-compliance with the duties connected to the functions of the responsible person.

The court dismissed the FCPA charge because the United States did not have jurisdiction over Bodmer (a non-U.S.-resident foreign national who served as an agent of a domestic concern) at the time the  conduct occurred (prior to the 1998 amendment to the FCPA). Bodmer cooperated with the government in its investigation of Bourke, including testifying against him at trial.

He was also ordered to pay a USD 1 million fine and serve three years of supervised release after his prison term.  Bourke has been released on bail pending appeal of his conviction.At trial, Bourke raised a number of defenses, including requesting a jury instruction on the local law defense, which states that payments that are legal under the laws of the country in which they are made cannot be prosecuted. According to Bourke's attorneys, bribe payments cannot be prosecuted in Azerbaijan if they are a result of extortion and subsequently disclosed to the government. The judge in the case rejected this argument, holding that in order for the payments to fall under the local law defense the payments themselves must be legal under local law. In this case, the bribe payments were illegal under Azeri law, even though Bourke would have been absolved from criminal liability had he faced an extortionate situation and disclosed the payments.  On 14 December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Frederic Bourke's 2009 conviction of conspiring to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act.  The court rejected Bourke's challenge, finding sufficient evidence to uphold both theories presented by the government that Bourke both knew of the bribes and ""consciously avoided"" learning about them.  The court stated that a ""rational juror could conclude that Bourke deliberately avoided confirming his suspicions"" and that the same evidence ""may also be used to infer that Bourke actually knew about the crimes.""  The court also rejected Bourke's petition for a new trial.Bourke appealed a second time, asking for an en banc review of his conviction.  He remains on bail pending a decision on this appeal.  In the second appeal, Bourke's attorneys argue based on revelations by prosecutors during the first appeal, that they knew that Hans Bodmer's testimony (which helped convict Bourke) was false, but prosecutors neither disclosed the information to Bourke's trial attorneys, nor confronted Bodmer at the trial.  This prosecutorial misconduct, claims Bourke, tainted the jury's verdict.  Specifically, Bourke's conviction was based largely on Bodmer's assertions that Bourke knew of the Azeri bribery scheme, and that he (Bodmer)  told Bourke about the scheme during a walk taken by Bourke and Bodmer in Baku on 6 February 1998; knowledge of the scheme at this date would establish Bourke's awareness prior to his investment in the venture.  But flight records in the government's possession show that Bourke was not in Baku on that date. A hearing on Bourke's appeal took place on 6 November 2012.  On 28 November 2012, the three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a ruling denying  Bourke's appeal on the grounds that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bourke's motion to hold an evidentiary hearing, as there was no evidence that the government's witness committed perjury. On 25 October 2012, Bourke filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. On 15 April 2013, the Supreme Court denied the petition.",A1012N48J0Z65N,Yes,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,Yes,Yes,2015-04-17 04:07:30 UTC,,Yes3HXK2V1N4KF97KZ01KRU73SSB6X2GU,137,"On 23 March 1990, Mr. Gurin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

It is understood that by 2005 concern had been expressed by UK government officials as to the impact that the investigation was having on national security because of the deterioration in relations with Saudi Arabia due to the investigation. It was thought that as the investigation progressed that the continued deterioration in the UK/Saudi relations could have resulted in the Saudi authorities deciding not to cooperate with the UK in the fight against terrorism. The difficulties with the Saudi authorities increased as the investigation progressed and greatly increased with an attempt by the SFO to gain access to Swiss bank accounts to see if payments had been made by BAE to any agent or public official of Saudi Arabia. The Director of the SFO (""the Director"") was informed of the increasing difficulties with the Saudi authorities. He took advice from other officials and met on three occasions with the UK's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. On 14 December 2006, the Director decided that the Al Yamamah investigation should be terminated because of the ""need to safeguard national and international security.""  The SFO denied that there were any commercial grounds for calling off the probe.The Director's decision was challenged by two not-for-profit organizations.  In a judgment given on 10 April 2008, the UK High Court found that the Director's decision to discontinue the investigation of the alleged corruption was unlawful. This was largely due to the fact that the High Court found that the Director had succumbed to threats made by Saudi officials.  The Court found that the Director was required to act independently and his actions should be independent of any influence either from the UK government or from threats issued by foreign government.  The Director appealed the matter to the House of Lords, which was then the final court of appeal for cases in England and Wales.  The House of Lord's judgment was published on 30 July 2008 and, in summary, held that the Director's decision was not unlawful as the polycentric character of the official decision making did not make it susceptible to judicial review.  It was not within either the constitutional function nor the practical competence of the Court to assess the merit of the decision made by the Director.  The person to whom the power to make a decision had been delegated had been given decision-making powers that were very broad and on unprescribed terms.  During the investigation allegations had been made against a number of individuals connected with BAE; it is presumed that the UK investigation into those associated allegations came to an end with the conclusion of the main Al Yamamah investigation.With regard to the SFO investigation into BAE's activities in Central and Eastern Europe and Africa, in the fall of 2009 the SFO had, after giving BAE a deadline in which to come to an agreement with the SFO, made a public announcement that it intended to seek the Attorney General's consent to prosecute BAE.  It was not clear from the press statement when papers were to be submitted to the Attorney General.  In the end, no prosecution occurred.  On 5 February 2010 the SFO announced that it has reached a settlement with BAE to end the long-running investigation into alleged bribery.  Under the settlement, BAE will plead guilty in the Crown Court to violating Section 221 of the Companies Act 1985 by failing to keep reasonably accurate accounting records in connection with commission payments made to a former marketing adviser that assisted the company in selling a radar system to the Tanzanian government in 1999.  The company agreed to pay a penalty of GBP 30 million (approximately USD 47 million), comprising a fine to be determined by the Crown Court and the balance to be made as a charitable donation for the benefit of Tanzania.  On 21 December 2010, Southwark Crown Court approved the plea agreement between BAE and the SFO, sentencing BAE to pay a GBP 500,000 (USD 775,000) fine, plus GBP 225,000 in costs incurred by the SFO.  BAE will make an ex gratia payment of GBP 29.5 million for the benefit of the people of Tanzania, through a mechanism yet to be determined.  This brings to an end the SFO's six-year investigation into foreign bribery allegations connected to BAE's defense contracts.  On 29 January 2010, the SFO had charged Count Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly with conspiracy to corrupt, contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977, in connection with his role as a BAE agent in Central and Eastern Europe between 2002 and 2008.  Following the SFO's settlement with BAE on February 5, the SFO announced that its charges against Mensdorff-Pouilly would be withdrawn.  Mensdorff-Pouilly is still under investigation by Austrian prosecutors and may still face charges there.  On 15 March 2012, the SFO, BAE, and the Department for International Development (DFID) signed a Memorandum of Understanding, requiring BAE to pay GBP 29.5 million plus accrued interest for educational projects in Tanzania.  The sum will be used to purchase the following goods and services:  textbooks for all 16,000 primary schools in the country (benefiting 8.3 million children); teachers' guides and syllabi for 175,000 primary school teachers; desks for schools in nine of the neediest districts (GBP 5 million).  The Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Richard Alderman, expressed satisfaction at the arrangement, saying, ""This agreement is a first for the SFO which piloted it through the UK legal system. It provides a satisfactory outcome for all concerned but most of all for the Tanzanian people and I am personally delighted that SFO staff were able to achieve this.""United StatesOn 5 February 2010, BAE also reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (â€œDOJâ€ù).  Under the settlement, BAE agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiring to make false statements to the U.S. government in connection with certain regulatory filings and undertakings.  The Company agreed to pay a USD 400 million fine and to make additional commitments concerning its ongoing compliance.  The DOJ settlement covers misconduct related to BAE's business activities in multiple countries, including the company's involvement in Sweden's lease of Gripen fighter jets to the Czech Republic and Hungary in the late 1990s, as well as the company's ""Al Yamamah"" sales of Tornado aircraft and other defense materials to Saudi Arabia between the mid-1980s and early 2000s.According to the criminal information, from 2000 BAE agreed to and knowingly and willfully made certain false, inaccurate and incomplete statements to the U.S. government and failed to honor certain undertakings given to the U.S. government, as follows: (i) BAE agreed to create and implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the FCPA and OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, which it failed to comply with; (ii) BAE made false, inaccurate and incomplete statements to the U.S. government with regard to certain regulatory requirements, including applications for arms export licenses under the Arms Export Control Act (""AECA"") and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (""ITAR"").  BAE failed to follow-through on commitments made to the Department of Defense and the DOJ in 2000 regarding the company's anti-bribery compliance program, as demonstrated by the company's internal controls failures that allowed substantial payments to third party ""marketing advisers"" around the world to go under-scrutinized.  Many of these payments were made through offshore shell entities and in circumstances where there was a high probability that a portion of the payments were being passed on to foreign officials to secure business for BAE.  The company took various measures to conceal its relationships with certain of these advisers and its undisclosed payments to them, including by maintaining the adviser contracts and related materials in secretive legal trusts in offshore locations.  According to the criminal information, after making representations to the U.S. government regarding its anti-bribery compliance program in 2000, BAE made payments of over GBP 135 million and USD 14 million to certain of its marketing advisers through an offshore entity in the British Virgin Islands.BAE also made false statements to the Department of State by failing to disclose commission payments made to third parties who assisted in the sale of defense articles abroad.  With regard to the lease of Saab Gripen fighter jets by the Swedish government to the Czech Republic and Hungary - for which BAE provided various marketing services - the company caused false statements to be made in export license applications.  BAE made over GBP 19 million to an individual to help promote the deals in circumstances where there was a high probability that part of the payments would be used to favor BAE in the tender process.  BAE did not subject these payments to proper review and scrutiny and caused the Swedish government to omit the payments in its export license applications made to the Department of State.   Finally, the criminal information also discusses a series of undisclosed payments made to Saudi officials in connection with BAE's sale of Tornado aircraft and other defense materials under the ""Al Yamamah"" arrangement between the UK and Saudi governments since the mid-1980's.  Over the course of the arrangement, BAE provided substantial benefits to one key Saudi official (believed to be Prince Bandar bin Sultan) and his associates, for which no adequate review, verification or due diligence was conducted.  Such benefits included over USD 5 million in invoices submitted between May 2001 and early 2002 for travel, lodging, security services, real estate, automobiles and personal items.  BAE also used intermediaries and shell entities to conceal various payments to certain advisers that assisted in securing contracts related to the Saudi fighter deal.  Between May 2001 and early 2002, BAE transferred over GBP 10 million and over USD 9 million to a Swiss bank account controlled by an intermediary in circumstances demonstrating a high probability that the intermediary would transfer a part of the sums to the key Saudi official.  According to the criminal information, the various false statements made to the U.S. government resulted in a USD 200 million gain for BAE.  On 1 March 2010, BAE formally pleaded guilty as planned in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, with the court approving the DOJ settlement and sentencing the company to pay a USD 400 million criminal fine. Under the terms of the plea agreement, BAE agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor for a three year term to assess the company's compliance program.  The monitor was to be retained within 90 days of the agreement, but BAE missed this deadline due to disagreements with the DOJ over the candidates put forward.  On 4 June 2010, the court granted BAE a 90-day extension for appointing a monitor.  In August, BAE finally appointed British attorney David Gold of Herbert Smith LLP as its corporate monitor.  In a related export controls enforcement action, on 16 May 2011, BAE entered into a Consent Agreement with the US Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) related to 2,591 ITAR violations.  BAE agreed to pay USD 79 million in civil penalties and to undertake extensive remedial compliance measures over a 4 year period.  Three non-US BAE affiliates were barred from receiving export licenses.  The case is unique in that it involves violations by a non-US person of ITAR Part 129 (brokering provisions) and Part 130 violations due to a failure to submit reports of commissions paid.  AustriaThe Vienna Prosecution Office investigated the case against Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly and eventually brought charges against the Count for acting as a middleman for BAE to pay 12.6 million euros in bribes in order to obtain contracts for the sale of weapons systems in Central and Eastern Europe.On 17 January 2013, Mensdorff-Pouilly was acquitted, as the prosecution had not proved the money laundering and perjury charges that had been brought.  The prosecutor noted that he had declined to bring bribery charges because of lack of proof regarding the recipients of the bribes.South AfricaAccording to press reports on 15 October 2010, South African authorities had closed their decade-long investigation into BAE's alleged bribery of South African officials in connection with sales of fighter jets and other defense equipment.  The investigation would have reportedly taken at least another five years to complete and was not in the best interests of the public, according to Anwa Dramat, the head of the Hawks investigative unit in the National Prosecuting Authority.According to press reports on 15 September 2011, President Zuma will be setting up a commission of inquiry to look into the broader scandal.",A2WGW5Y3ZFBDEC,Yes,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,Yes,Yes,2015-04-17 03:53:09 UTC,,Yes3VO4XFFP15M76AQKASD1X8D2S9S7QA,141,"United StatesOn 29 May 2013, Total settled its FCPA charges with the SEC and DOJ for a combined amount of USD 398.2 million.

The DOJ charged Total with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, one count of violating the FCPA's books and records provisions, and one count of violating the FCPA's internal controls provisions.

In 2009, the Prosecutor's Office recommended dismissing the case for the CEO and all of the Group's current and former employees.  In late 2009 a new Investigating Judge, Serge Tournaire, placed Total under formal investigation for bribery of a foreign public official, complicity and benefiting from influence peddling. The Company's Form 20-F submitted to the SEC on 26 March 2012 provides the following chronology of the events:""In 2009, the Prosecutor's office recommended to the investigating judge that the case against the Group's current and former employees and TOTAL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer not be pursued.

The trial lasted until 20 February 2013. The Wall Street Journal reported on 29 May 2013 that prosecutors in France recommended that Total and de Margerie be sent to trial for corruption and embezzlement.On 8 July 2013, a French court acquitted Total, its chief executive, Christophe de Margerie, former government minister, Charles Pasqua, and more than a dozen other defendants of corruption charges. The court ruled there had been ""no corruption, influence-peddling or misuse of assets"" linked to the $64 billion UN program that allowed Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy humanitarian supplies, even though the nation was under sanctions at the time.On 25 November 2014,  the Paris prosecutor's office announced that Total will face trial in France over claims of corruption related to Iranian contracts dating from the 1990s and early 2000s.ItalyThe Financial Times reported on 17 December 2008 that Italian authorities arrested three Total employees as part of a bribery investigation of Total's Tempa Rossa (Gorgoglione) oilfield concession. Among these employees were the French head of operations for Total Italia, Lionel Levha, and two Italian employees of the subsidiary. Authorities also searched two Total Italia offices. Multiple Italian politicians and businessmen were also arrested or are facing investigations of bribery allegations in relation to the oilfield concession. Among these was the former head of the Tempa Rossa concession, Jean Paul Juguet, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.In its Form 20-F submitted to the SEC on 26 March 2012, Total provided the following information regarding the investigation being conducted by the Prosecutor of the Republic of the Potenza Court: ""On February 16, 2009, as a preliminary measure before the proceedings go before the Court, the preliminary investigation judge of Potenza served notice to Total Italia of a decision that would suspend the concession for this field for one year.

ASIC has slowly made progress in its civil cases against former AWB directors.Lindberg ProsecutionOn 31 May 2012, ASIC announced ""a significant milestone"" in its case against Andrew Alexander Lindberg, former Managing Director of AWB.  At a hearing, Lindberg admitted to four violations of the Corporations Act of 2001 arising out of the organization's supply of wheat under the Oil-for-Food Program and in the subsequent investigation by AWB.The four violations acknowledged by Lindberg are described in an ASIC press release:   Allegations had been made publicly regarding the Iraq transactions, leading to the commencement of Project Rose, the code name for AWB's internal investigation into AWB's wheat exports to Iraq, in June 2003.  The investigation covered sales between 1999 and 2002, including inland transport of wheat within Iraq.  Lindberg's first admitted contravention was his failure to inform the Project Rose investigators that the information they needed might be accessible through interviews with former, not current, AWB employees and the former Chairman, and that these individuals had not been interviewed. Lindberg's second contravention is the failure to ascertain whether AWB's decision to help the Tigris Petroleum Corporation Limited to recover a debt owed to it by the Iraqi Grains Board violated UN Security Council resolutions, and whether the UN knew of the plan to help Tigris recover the debt.The third contravention acknowledged by Lindberg is that he knew that AWB had been paid an inflated price designed to cover the Tigris debt, from a UN escrow account.  Moreover, a December 2004 agreement between AWB and Tigris failed to reveal that AWB had helped Tigris recover its debt in exchange for a USD 500,000 fee, showing instead that Tigris had rendered services to help procure contracts for the sale of AWB wheat to Iraq, and that AWB would pay a USD 7,087,202 ""service fee"" to Tigris.  This was the amount payable to Tigris after the deduction of the USD 500,000.  The agreement described the USD 500,000 as a ""success fee.""  Lindberg's fault was in his failure to inform the AWB that the USD 8 million Tigris debt had been recovered from UN accounts through the inflation of sales prices for AWB wheat.  Lindberg also failed to reveal the existence of the Tigris agreement.The fourth contravention acknowledged by Lindberg is that he was on the conference call for a meeting with AWB's in-house and external lawyers on 20 February 2005, at which reference was made to allegations that AWB paid a 10% mark-up to the IGB through Alia;  furthermore, Lindberg was present at a meeting with the attorneys at which the 10% mark-up was questioned specifically and in detail.  Eight days later, on 28 February 2005, Lindberg was interviewed by investigators representing the UN Independent Inquiry Committee (""IIC"").  He was specifically informed that the Iraqi Minister of Trade had told the IIC that all suppliers under the OFFP had paid kickbacks to the Iraqi government, that AWB was the biggest supplier, that it always paid a 10% ""after sales service"" fee through Alia.  And yet, between February and September 2005, Lindberg did not inform the AWB board of the information conveyed to him by the IIC, and the serious allegations therein.Mr. Lindberg agreed to a fine of AUD 100,000 and disqualification from managing corporations until 15 September 2014.  The Supreme Court of Victoria entered the order confirming this sentence on 9 August 2012.  The judge noted that Lindberg's  ""contraventions did not involve deliberate wrongful acts, dishonesty or any moral turpitude but that Mr Lindberg had nonetheless 'failed to perform his duties as a reasonable director or officer would in his situation.'""Ingleby ProsecutionOn 13 June 2012, a second AWB defendant admitted to breach of fiduciary duty.  In a civil action brought by ASIC against former AWB CFO Paul John Ingleby, violations of section 180(1) of the Corporations Act of 2001 were confirmed.  Ingleby acknowledged that between December 2001 and September 2004, he knew that AWB's trade was conducted under the OFFB, which prohibited direct payments to the Iraqi government.  He nevertheless co-authorized payments to the Jordanian trucking company, Alia for Transportation, despite having information available to raise questions as to the legitimacy of these fees, and furthermore took no steps to ascertain whether indeed payments were being made to the government of Iraq.  On 10 August 2012, the judge found Ingelby in contravention of Section 180(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act) and ordered that he be disqualified from managing corporations until 31 December 2012 and pay a pecuniary penalty of AUD 10,000.  The penalty was less severe than anticipated, as both ASIC and Mr Ingleby had recommended  a disqualification of 15 months and apenalty of AUD 40,000.   On 27 August 2012, ASIC filed a notice of appeal against the court's judgment, claiming (1) that the penalties it had recommended were within the range of penalties appropriate to Ingleby's contravention, and (2) Ingleby had agreed that such penalties were appropriate, in the joint statement he signed and submitted, with ASIC, to the court.Other ProsecutionsASIC's proceedings against the four other named former officers of AWB are ongoing.",A2WGW5Y3ZFBDEC,I can't tell,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,No,no_agreement,2015-04-17 04:05:16 UTC,,Yes3ZZAYRN1I6RRJWAB8IOYDZAK250OTU,148,"United States In February 2009 Halliburton and KBR settled FCPA charges related to its involvement in the scheme, resulting in USD 579 million in combined penalties.

The company stated that it did not expect a criminal conviction for its role in the joint venture.On 28 June 2010, the Department of Justice filed a deferred prosecution agreement and two-count information against Technip in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charging the company with one count of conspiracy and one count of violating the FCPA.  Under the terms of the two-year deferred prosecution agreement, Technip agreed to pay a USD $240 million criminal fine, to retain an independent compliance monitor for a two-year period, and to cooperate with the DOJ in its ongoing investigations.On the same day, Technip reached a settlement of a related civil complaint with the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Technip agreed to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions.  Technip agreed to pay USD 98 million in disgorgement of profits and pre-judgment interest.  NigeriaThe press reported that Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (""EFCC"") had arrested ten Halliburton employees in Nigeria during a raid of the offices of Halliburton Energy Services Nigeria Limited in Lagos on 25 November 2010.   The EFCC also arrested one employee each from Saipem Contracting Nigeria and Technip Offshore Nigeria.  On 7 December 2010, the EFCC reportedly filed corruption charges against Halliburton, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney (who was the CEO of Halliburton during the period at issue), Albert Stanley (former CEO of KBR), David Lesar (current CEO of Halliburton) and William Utt (current CEO of KBR).  Technip, Snamprogetti and JGC Corp. were reportedly also charged on the same day.  The case number is Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Halliburton and others, CV/435/10, High Court of Justice, Abuja Judicial Division (Abuja).According to press reports, on 15 December 2010, Halliburton and the EFCC reached a USD $250 million settlement agreement to resolve the charges.  Halliburton will pay USD $120 million in penalties and USD $130 million in frozen assets in Switzerland will be repatriated to Nigeria.  In exchange, Nigeria dropped the charges.  Former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker reportedly assisted with the negotiations.  On 20 December 2010, Saipem announced that Snamprogetti had entered into a settlement agreement and non-prosecution agreement with the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the investigation.  Snamprogetti agreed to the payment of a criminal penalty of USD $30 million, along with USD $2.5 million in reimbursement for legal costs and expenses incurred by the Nigerian authorities.  Nigeria agreed to dismiss all charges against Snamprogetti and to renounce to any civil claims and criminal charges in any jurisdiction.FranceAccording to several news sources, on 30 January 2013, Technip's former General Manager, Jean-Marie Deseilligny, was found guilty by a Paris court in relation to the Bonny Island affair and ordered to pay a EUR 10,000 fine.  That same day, Technip's former commercial manager for Africa, Etienne Gory, was sentenced by the Paris court to a EUR 5,000 fine.  These fines fell short of the EUR 100,000 fine that prosecutors had reportedly requested.African Development BankOn 21 March 2014, the African Development Bank levied a USD $5.3 million fine against Technip for corrupt practices in connection to contracts for natural gas production plants on Bonny Island, Nigeria from 1995 until 2004.",A2WGW5Y3ZFBDEC,Yes,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,Yes,Yes,2015-04-17 03:55:35 UTC,,No336OE47KI2KE1XN24ZFNVBBR2SFWVU,149,"United NationsAccording to a 2 May 2008 article in the New Zealand Herald, Radiola's managing director Brent Albiston said that ""[w]e were suspended while the UN was conducting its investigations and we can confirm we have since been reinstated and are now an approved supplier.""

In the township court, Norconsult was acquitted, but on appeal, the court found Norconsult guilty of corruption and bribery in 2012.In the appeal court, one of the employees was acquitted, and the fine upheld for the company. The appeal court rated the legal circumstances different from the town court. They considered the corruptive actions to be considerable, and found without reasonable doubt that one or more employees had participated in illegal payments for about 100 000 USD on behalf of Norconsult. The main reasons for the appeal court to convict Norconsult for grand corruption was the following: It was documented an organized bribery system in a poor country and by that general deterrence considerations was relevant. There was lack of preventive measures related to anti-corruption in Norconsult. There was no specific anticorruption policy or guidelines for the employees in order to deal with corruptive issues.  The project was documented to be important for Norconsult, even if there was a deficit in the project. Norconsult did not allow internal and external investigation reports to be documented for the authorities, and there was an internal struggle in order to report the matter to the authorities.

ABB Vetco Gray UK was only the second company charged under the provisions of the FCPA that cover foreign companies that take an act in furtherance of bribing a foreign official while in the territory of the United States.  The acts in question included making improper payments to U.S. bank accounts and reimbursing ABB Vetco Gray for bribes paid to Nigerian officials.   On the same day, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, ABB consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from committing future violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions. ABB was required to pay a total of USD 16.4 million in penalties, including USD 5.9 million in disgorgement of profits and a USD 10.5 million civil penalty. The SEC also required ABB to retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA compliance policies and procedures.  In a related case, on 5 July 2006, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Samson, Munro, Campbell and Whelan consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining each of them from future violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions. In addition, Samson was ordered to pay a USD 50,000 civil penalty and USD 64,674 in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest and Campbell and Munro were each required to pay a USD 40,000 civil penalty.

Kay was sentenced to 3 years and 1 month in prison and was ordered to pay USD 1,300 in criminal penalties. Murphy was sentenced to 5 years and 3 months in prison and was ordered to pay USD 1,400 in criminal penalties. In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a 2002 lower court ruling that had dismissed the charges against the defendants. The lower court had ruled that the FCPA did not prohibit bribes to foreign officials that were intended to reduce customs duties. The decision turned on language in the FCPA that prohibits bribes that are made for the purpose of ""obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person."" Based on this language, the lower court determined that the FCPA was only intended to prohibit bribes made to obtain specific foreign government contracts. The Fifth Circuit disagreed with the lower court's holding that as a matter of law, bribes to reduce foreign tax and customs obligations were not prohibited by the FCPA and concluded that such bribes could in certain circumstances violate the act. On 6 October 2004, a jury found defendant Murphy guilty of 12 counts of violating the FCPA, one count of a conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of obstruction of justice. Defendant Kay was found guilty of 12 counts of violating the FCPA and one count of a conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Kay and Murphy appealed their convictions based on arguments that the court retroactively enlarged the scope of the statute so that the defendants were not given fair notice that the conduct in which they engaged could be prosecuted under the FCPA. Part of their argument was that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as to the definition of ""obtain or retain business."" On 24 October 2007, the Fifth Circuit rejected the defendants' arguments, stating that while the term ""obtain or retain business"" was ambiguous it did not rise to the level of being unconstitutionally vague.  The Fifth Circuit denied Kay and Murphy's petition for a rehearing en banc on 10 January 2008, and the Supreme Court denied their petition for cert on 6 October 2008. Murphy is currently serving out his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in El Reno, Texas. Kay is serving his sentence at Texarkana.   On 1 August 2002, the SEC filed a civil action, requesting that the court permanently enjoin Kay, Murphy and Theriot from committing future violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA.  In addition, the SEC requested that Kay and Murphy each pay USD 187,000 civil penalty.  On 7 January 2005, Theriot consented to the entry of a final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations. The SEC's civil actions against Kay and Murphy are still pending.

Count one listed three separate conspiracies, including conspiracy to solicit bribes and conspiracy to deprive citizens of honest services. The judge instructed the jury that in order for them to find Jefferson guilty of count one, they only needed to find that he engaged in two of the three conspiracies.

Six individuals from Victoria - who previously worked for Securency or NPA as chief executives, chief financial officers or sales agents - were arrested and charged as well.  According to the AFP, the Australian arrests coincided with related bribery charges laid against two individuals in Malaysia by the Malaysian Attorney Generalâ€™s Chambers, following an investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.  The charges against Securency and NPA carry a maximum fine of AUD 330,000 per offense.  The charges against the six individuals carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of AUD 1.1 million, under sections 11.5(1) and 70.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995.

Specifically, Ellery admitted that he created a false document to facilitate a payment to Kayum even though he knew the latter  was not entitled to it.  Ellery is one of nine individuals to have been indicted by the Australian Federal Police.  In accepting his guilty plea, the Victoria Supreme Court acknowledged Ellery's willingness to testify against the eight remaining defendants.  Ellery's counsel noted that his client had not been involved in a wider conspiracy, and falsified documents at the behest of his superiors, and even that Ellery had warned senior colleagues at Securency that Kayum was not entitled to any money from the company. Following a hearing on 18 July 2012, the Supreme Court of Victoria (Melbourne) issued a sentencing judgment on 20 August 2012.  Ellery's offenses could invoke a maximum 10 year prison sentence.  The judge went to great lengths to explain Ellery's offense and the court's reasoning.  Ellery approved a commission payment to Kayum in Malaysia of AUD 79,502.  Later, when an invoice fabricated by Kayum reflected the same amount but showed an itemized list of ""expenses,"" Ellery forwarded it for payment.  When questioned about the ""expenses"" subsequently, Ellery concealed the nature of the payment.  In his favor, the judge noted that Ellery did not create the false document, did not at first wish to approve it, ultimately approved it without any idea of personal gain.  When confronted, Ellery pleaded guilty early in the proceedings, and agreed to cooperate in ongoing investigations both of Securency and NPA offenses in Malaysia and other jurisdictions.The judge therefore sentenced Ellery to 6 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, meaning that the sentence could be imposed if, at any time during the coming two years, Ellery commits another offense punishable by imprisonment.Australia: Other IndividualsAmended charge sheets were issued against 8 individuals on 14 August 2012:  Anderson, Boillot, Brady, Curtis, Gerathy, Hutchinson, Leckenby and  Marchant.

He also admitted to submitting false invoices and helping to fabricate correspondence in contemplation of the government's investigations.  Basurto agreed to cooperate with the DOJ's ongoing investigation.  He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of the greater of USD 250,000 or twice the value gained or lost.  (Basurto was previously arrested in Dallas, Texas on 25 April 2009 in connection wtih a criminal complaint charging him with conspiracy to structure transactions and structuring transactions to evade currency reporting requirements.  He was subsequently detained and, on 10 June 2009, was indicted on those charges.)  In April 2012, Judge Hughes dismissed the original charges against Basurto, and granted the prosecution's request that Basurto's sentence not extend beyond the twenty-two months he spent in jail between his arrest in 2009 and his release on bail in July 2011.  The judge agreed to limit the sentence to ""time served.""  The requirement in his plea agreement that he forfeit approximately USD 2 million in illegal profits remains in place.On 29 September 2010, the SEC filed a settled civil action against ABB Ltd., charging the company with violating the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions in connection with bribes allegedly paid, through its subsidiaries, to Mexican government officials to obtain business with state-owned electric utilities, and to the former Iraqi regime to obtain contracts under the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations the SEC's allegations, ABB Ltd. consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from future violations of the FCPA.  ABB Ltd. was ordered to pay USD 22,804,262 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a USD 16,510,000 civil penalty, and is also required to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program.Also on 29 September 2010, ABB Ltd. and two of its subsidiaries reached settlements with the DOJ regarding the agency's criminal investigation into the matter.  At a plea hearing in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, ABB Ltd.'s U.S. subsidiary, ABB Inc., pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging it with one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to violate these provisions.  ABB Inc. was ordered to pay a criminal fine of USD 17.1 million.  ABB Ltd. itself entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, agreeing to cooperate with the ongoing investigations of the DOJ and foreign authorities, as well as to various enhanced corporate compliance and reporting obligations, including the recommendations of an independent compliance consultant.  ABB Ltd. also agreed to the DOJ's filing of a criminal information charging its Jordanian subsidiary, ABB Near East Trading Ltd., with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the FCPA's books and records provisions of the FCPA, and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of USD 1.9 million.The DOJ and ABB had originally agreed to a USD 28.1 million criminal fine.  U.S. District Court Judge Lynn Hughes, however, reduced the fine to USD 17.1 million, disagreeing with the DOJ's assessment of ABB as a recidivist company and refusing to ""rubber stamp"" the agency's settlements. The bribery and cover up trial against O'Shea's opened on 11 January 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.   Earlier in January, Judge Lynn Hughes had denied O'Shea's motion to dismiss the indictment based on the claim that the state-owned Mexican electric company, Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) whose employees allegedly received payments were not ""foreign officials"" within the meaning of the FCPA.On 16 January 2012, the Court acquitted O'Shea of all bribery and cover-up charges, on the grounds that the evidence did not sufficiently demonstrate a link between O'Shea and the illegal conduct.  Then, on 9 February 2012, the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss all remaining charges against O'Shea.  The remaining charges included conspiracy, obstruction of justice and money laundering.It  is unclear what become of the Italian investigation into ABB Italy's alleged bribery of Italian officials.

Both companies acquiesced in the decisions.  These fines mark the closure of the investigations against the companies of the MAN Group regarding the alleged bribery between 2002 and 2009.  According to MAN, the settlements were possible due to the extensive measures taken by MAN's Executive Board and Supervisory Board to conduct an internal investigation and cooperate with the public prosecution authorities.  According to press reports, on 11 December 2009, Munich prosecutors filed charged against Heinz Juergen Maus, the former chief executive of MAN Turbo, in connection with EUR 9 million in bribes - described as ""market entry fees"" - allegedly paid to Kazakh officials between 2005 and 2008 in order to secure a gas pipeline modernization contract and gas turbine compressor orders in Kazakhstan.

Two days later the government filed a deferred prosecution agreement in the case.  Under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, Daimler Russia and Daimler Export were to plead guilty to FCPA violations and Daimler would be required to appoint a compliance monitor for a three-year period.  In addition,  the company would be required to adopt a number of remedial measures. The deferred prosecution agreement names former FBI Director Louis Freeh as the company's preferred compliance monitor. On 1 April 2010, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Daimler Russia and Daimler Export each pleaded guilty to criminal informations charging the companies with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating those provisions.  Under the plea agreements, Daimler Russia and Daimler Export agreed to pay criminal fines of USD 27.26 million and USD 29.12 million, respectively.On 25 April 2012, the Investigative Committee elected not to open cases against officials from the Defense Ministry and the Ufa administration or against employees of the companies Daimler Chrysler Avtomobili RUS, Urengoigazprom, Mashinoimport, and Dorinvest, all of whom were implicated in the case by U.S. authorities.  Press reports indicate that Russian investigators never requested  materials regarding the case from U.S. authorities, as Russian authorities had earlier indicated. Like the Russia DPA and on the same date, 1 April 2010, Daimler formally entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, per the terms described above, consenting to the filing of a criminal information charging it with one count of conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating those provisions. Daimler China also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, consenting to the filing of a criminal information charging it with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating those provisions. In total, Daimler and its three subsidiaries agreed to pay USD 93.6 million in criminal fines and penalties.  The three subsidiaries are covered by the monitoring provisions of the deferred prosecution agreement entered into by Daimler. On the same day, a separate judgment was entered against Daimler resolving a related civil complaint filed by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's charges, Daimler consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining the company from future violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.  Daimler agreed to pay USD 91.4 million in disgorgement of profits relating to those violations and agreed to certain remedial measures, including retaining an independent consultant for a three-year period.Under its settlement with the government, Daimler entities agreed to pay a total of USD 185 million in fines and penalties, comprising USD 93.6 million in criminal fines and USD 91.4 million in civil penalties. According to the deferred prosecution agreement, the USD 93.6 million criminal fine represents a 20 percent reduction from the lowest fine recommended by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines due to Daimler's extensive cooperation with the investigation. RussiaAccording to reports from the Moscow Times on 29 April 2010, in early April Russian prosecutors sent a request to the DOJ requesting information about bribes paid by Daimler in Russia.  The request was apparently prompted by a personal order from President Dmitry Medvedev following a Russian internet petition signed by thousands asking the Prosecutor General's Office and the Interior Ministry to begin an investigation.  The Moscow Times on 30 April 2010 reported that Moscow City Hall had asked Daimler to ""clarify the situation"" regarding bribes reportedly paid to Moscow city government officials to secure sales contracts for its Mercedes vehicles.  The mayor's press secretary said that Moscow does not own any Mercedes vehicles.  City Hall considers the allegations inaccurate and Daimler could face legal action as a result.On 20 May 2010, Bloomberg reported that the DOJ had given documents to prosecutors in Moscow, prompting Russia to open a formal investigation into the matter.  On 12 November 2010, Russian prosecutors confirmed that they had opened a criminal investigation into the matter.EgyptOn 14 May 2010, several media outlets reported that the Egyptian government had also opened an investigation into Daimler's alleged payment of bribes to Egyptian officials.NigeriaAccording to press reports in June 2010, Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (""EFCC"") is also investigating the matter, looking at alleged bribery involving Daimler and Anammco, a partially state-owned Nigerian vehicle assembly company.LatviaAccording to a 15 February 2011 press release by Latvia's Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (""KNAB""), the agency is investigating alleged bribery of Riga city officials by Daimler's subsidiary EvoBus GmbH.

The DOJ and Pride entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve the charges.  The DOJ also filed a criminal information charging Pride Forasol with conspiring to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions; violating the anti-bribery provisions; and aiding and abetting the violation of the books and records provisions. Pride Forasol agreed to plead guilty to the charges, which the company did on December 7, 2010 in U.S. District Court in Houston. The two agreements require the payment of a USD 32.625 million criminal penalty.  The DOJ noted that ""During the course of the investigation, Pride provided information and substantially assisted in the investigation of Panalpina.""Also on November 4, 2010, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Pride consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest and permanently enjoining it from violating the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions.  Pride was ordered to disgorge USD 19,341,870 in profits, plus pre-judgment interest of USD 4,187,848.In the first such move ever in an FCPA case, on 2 November 2012, the government filed a motion to terminate the period of probation under the December 2010 DPA.  The government explained in its motion that since Pride's merger with Ensco plc, the latter has conducted appropriate due diligence on agents and business partners, and has assumed responsibility for the implementation and oversight of compliance.  ""In light of the foregoing circumstances, continuing the term of the defendant's probation is not required to 'protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.'... the sentence ... has promoted respect for the law and 'adequate deterrence' against international corruption... The government, therefore, has determined that no further purpose of the United States in the enforcement of the federal criiminal laws would be served by continuing the term of probation imposed on Pride Forasol.""

The indictments also seek criminal forfeiture of the Defendantsâ€™ ill-gotten gains.On 18 January 2010, approximately 150 FBI agents executed fourteen search warrants in locations across the country, and the United Kingdomâ€™s City of London Police executed seven search warrants in connection with their own investigations into companies involved in the foreign bribery conduct that formed the basis for the indictments. On 19 January 2010, the indictments were unsealed and the twenty-two Defendants were arrested.  Twenty-one were arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, where they were preparing to attend the 2010 Shooting, Hunting & Outdoor Trade (""SHOT"") Show in Las Vegas.  The final individual was arrested in Miami, Florida. On 3 February 2010, nineteen of the Defendants entered pleas of not-guilty at their arraignments, challenging prosecutors' single-conspiracy theory.  The remaining three Defendants were expected to be arraigned sometime during the week of 8 February. Under the original indictments, the Defendants each face a maximum prison sentence of five years for the conspiracy count and five years for each FCPA count.  The  money laundering conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison.As discussed above, on 5 March 2010, prosecutors filed a superseding information against Daniel Alvirez, in which he is charged with two counts of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  The information also seeks forfeiture of Alvirez's ill-gotten gains.  Alvirez now faces up to five years in prison for each of the two conspiracy counts.  He no longer faces the possible twenty-year sentence in connection with the previous money laundering charge, nor the possible five years in prison for each of the substantive FCPA offenses in the initial indictment.On 19 April 2010, the grand jury issued a superseding indictment against the 22 defendants, thereby consolidating the 16 separate cases.  The superseding indictment consists of 44 counts, including conspiracy to violate the FCPA, substantive FCPA violations, conspiracy to commit money laundering and aiding and abetting.  The same day, prosecutors filed a notice with the court proposing a plan for grouping the defendants into four manageable units for trial.  The presiding judge, Richard Leon, had stated on 3 February that he would not try all 22 defendants together. On 28 April 2010, 21 of the defendants (all but Daniel Alvirez) entered pleas of not guilty to the superseding indictment.  On 1 March 2011, Daniel Alvirez pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  He is expected to testify at trial against the other defendants.   On 29 March 2011 Jonathan Spiller pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  The substantive FCPA charges and the money laundering conspiracy charges were dropped.  Spiller faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  He could be expected to testify at trial against the other defendants.  On 28 April 2011, Haim Geri pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  The other charges were dropped.  He faces 18 to 24 months in prison and a USD 250,000 fine.On 7 July 2011, after seven days of jury deliberations following the six-week trial of the first four defendants - Pankesh Patel, Andrew Bigelow, John Benson Weir and Lee Allen Tolleson - U.S. District Judge Richard Leon declared a mistrial.  The jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict. On 22 December 2011, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon entered judgment acquitting Stephen G. Giordanella of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The Judge found that the Government's evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction after a twelve week jury trial in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On 30 January 2012, a jury acquitted  R. Patrick Caldwell and John Godsey of FCPA violations.   At the time of his arrest, Caldwell was CEO of Protective Products of America, Inc., a body armor company.  Godsey owned an ammunition and law enforcement equipment business.  A day later, on 31 January 2012, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon declared a mistrial in the case against defendants John and Jeana Mushriqui and Marc Morales, after the jury deliberated for ten days without reaching a consensus.On 21 February 2012, the government filed a motion in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, to dismiss with prejudice the superseding indictment and all underlying indictments against  the remaining defendants pending trial in the case.  In its motion, the government cited ""the impact of certain evidentiary and other legal rulings in the first two trials"" as well as cost, as its motives for seeking to close the case.  Earlier, news reports had accused the FBI of conducting the Sting operation in a highly unprofessional manner.Granting the government's motion to dismiss, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon noted, ""This appears to be the end of a long and sad chapter in the annals of white collar criminal enforcement.  Unlike takedown day in Las Vegas, however, there will be no front page story in the New York Times or the Post for that matter tomorrow reflecting the governmentâ€™s decision today to move to dismiss the charges against the remaining defendants in this case.  Funny isnâ€™t it what sells newspapers.""The good news, however, is that for these defendants, agents, prosecutors, defense counsel and the Court we can get on with our professional and personal lives without the constant strain and burden of three to four more eight week trials hanging over our heads.""I for one hope this very long, and Iâ€™m sure very expensive, ordeal will be a true learning experience for both the Department and the FBI as they regroup to investigate and prosecute FCPA cases against individuals in the future.""Following dismissal of the charges against all defendants except those who had pleaded guilty following their arrest at the outset of the investigation, the question remained what the Government would decide to do about the ""guilty"" defendants.  On 27 March 2012, the Government answered this question by filing a Motion to Dismiss with prejudice the superceding indictment filed against Jonathan Spiller, Haim Geri, Daniel Alvirez in March 2010.  The only charge left open for future prosecution is the conspiracy charge against Alvirez, which the government dismissed without prejudice, noting, ""The government has also concluded that it is in the interests of justice not to prosecute defendant Alvirez on the Georgia conspiracy count at this time, but rather to continue the investigation of that and related conduct. Following such investigation, the government will determine whether to bring criminal charges relating to that conduct.""The primary informant used by the FBI in the Sting operation, Richard Bistrong, was sentenced on 31 July 2012 to 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release for his role in FCPA violations while employed by Armor Holdings prior to the Sting.",A1012N48J0Z65N,Yes,A2WGW5Y3ZFBDEC,Yes,Yes,Yes,2015-04-17 03:58:39 UTC,,Yes3RHLQY6EDT4GYE4W389AUXMTISDD4R,173,"On 21 January 2010, the one-count criminal information against Bistrong was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.On 16 September 2010, Bistrong pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and other statutes.

Jenning allegedly violated the FCPA and aided and abetted Innospec's violations beginning in mid to late 2004 during his tenure as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and continuing after he became Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2005.  Jennings agreed to disgorge USD 116,092 (plus prejudgment interest of USD 12,945) and to pay a USD 100,000 civil penalty that, according to the SEC, takes into consideration Jennings' cooperation with the government's investigation.United Kingdom On 18 March 2010, Innospec Ltd. appeared in Southwark Crown Court  and pleaded guilty to bribing employees of Pertamina (an Indonesian state-owned refinery) and other  Indonesian in order to secure sales of tetraethyl lead.  A USD 12.7 million financial criminal penalty is to be imposed on Innospec Ltd.  On 26 March 2010, Innospec Ltd. entered a plea of guilty and was fined USD 12.7 million.  At the hearing in the Southwark Crown Court, Lord Justice Thomas  criticized the settlement, stating that the SFO had acted beyond its remit in negotiating the trans-Atlantic plea bargain and that the USD 12.7 million fine was ""inadequate.""  On 27 October 2011, Dennis Kerrison and Paul Jennings appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court on charges related to alleged corrupt payments to gain public contracts in Indonesia.  Mr Jennings is also charged in connection with corrupt payments in Iraq.  The case was transferred for Southwark Crown Court.  On 11 June 2012, Paul Jennings pleaded guilty in Southwark Crown Court to charges that he conspired to corrupt public officials in Indonesia between 2002 and 2008, and in Iraq between 2003 and 2009, in order to secure contracts for the supply of Innospec products such as tetraethyl lead.  Two other former Innospec executives who are defendants in the case, Miltos Papachristos and Dennis Kerrison, pleaded not guilty.  On 30 July 2012, Jennings pleaded guilty to an additional charge of conspiracy to corrupt Iraqi officials, by making payments designed to induce government inspectors to produce unfavorable test results of a competitor product. On 18 June 2014, Dennis Kerrison, a former Innospec chief executive, and Miltiades Papachristos, a former regional sales director, were convicted by a jury at the Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy and bribery.  According to the SFO, the bribes were intended to secure, or serve as rewards for having secured, contracts from the Government of Indonesia for the supply of Innospec products including Tetraethyl Lead, a highly dangerous organo-lead compound.On 19 September 2014, a U.K. court of appeal upheld the convictions against Mr. Kerrison and Mr. Papachristos.  The justices, however, reduced Mr. Kerrison's sentence from four years to three because the trial judge incorrectly considered the starting point for the sentence as four years instead of five.IndonesiaOn 9 April 2010, The Jakarta Post reported that Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission (""KPK"") had begun its own investigation into Innospec Ltd.'s activities in the country between 2000 and 2006. According to media reports in January 2012, Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission (Indonesian abbreviation ""KPK"") named a local agent for Innospec as a suspect in the Innospec bribery matter and charged the agent under Indonesian anti-corruption laws. According to media reports quoting a KPK spokesperson, Willy Sebastian Liem allegedly received over USD 17.48 million in commissions from Innospec and also channeled money to officials at the Energy Ministry, upstream oil and gas regulator BPMigas and state oil company Pertamina.On 17 January 2012, David Turner, Innospec's former Limited Global Sales and Marketing Director for Tetraethyl Lead, pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to corrupt.  The first two counts charged Turner with conspiracy to give corrupt payments to public officials in Indonesia and Iraq between 2002 and 2008 in order to secure contracts for the sale of Tetraethyl lead.  In addition, Dr. Turner pleaded guilty to charges that he effected improper payments to Iraqi officials in 2006 and 2007 in order to ensure that tests on a competitor product would result in unfavorable assessments.",A1012N48J0Z65N,Yes,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,Yes,Yes,2015-04-17 04:02:01 UTC,,Yes3FSEU3P2NR0H0UPZWL077FE7P7NRRT,175,"United StatesOn 16 April 2010, the DOJ and SEC commenced investigations into HP for possible FCPA violations relating to the Russia GPO deal.

According to the same story, all four executives are Chinese nationals. Bloomberg News also reported that the head of GSK in China, Mark Reilly, ""returned to the U.K. on a routine, planned business trip and has been working from company headquarters on the response to the investigation.""On 16 July 2013, The Telegraph cited a statement from the Ministry of Public Security as saying that ""[a]fter initial questioning the suspects have admitted to the crimes, and the investigation is ongoing.""

Additional details were unavailable.On 14 May 2014, Chinese prosecutors filed criminal charges against Mark Reilly, the former GSK China CEO.  Mr. Reilly allegedly ordered his sales teams to bribe doctors and hospitals to achieve the companyâ€™s sales targets, according to police in Changsha, Hunan province.  Two other GSK executives, allegedly helped execute the bribery scheme, which netted the company revenue worth billions of yuan.  GSKâ€™s drugs in China cost more than those in other countries because the company allegedly inflated drug prices to recoup bribery funds, according to Chinese police.On 19 September 2014, GSK agreed to pay an unprecedented USD $491.5 million to Chinese authorities after the companyâ€™s Chinese subsidiary was found guilty of bribery.  The ruling followed a one-day trial in Changsha, Hunan, and the penalty marks the largest corporate fine ever imposed in China.  Mr. Reilly was sentenced to three years in prison after allegedly ordering his sales teams to bribe doctors and hospitals to achieve the companyâ€™s sales targets.  Mr. Reilly received a three-year prison sentence that was suspended for four years; he will be expelled from China following the four-year suspended sentence.

Previously, on 1 December 2009, the UK SFO issued a summons alleging that Robert John Dougall, former Director of Marketing at DPI, conspired to corrupt in violation of the Criminal Law Act 1977 in connection with improper payments and other inducements allegedly made to Greek health care professionals.  On 14 April 2010, in Southwark Crown Court, Dougall pleaded guilty to violating section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, admitting to his involvement in connection with GBP 4.5 million in corrupt payments made to Greek medical professionals.

Noble was ordered to disgorge ill-gotten gains of USD 4,294,933 and pay prejudgment interest of USD 1,282,065.United States: IndividualsOn 24 February 2012, Mark Jackson and James Ruehlen were charged in a complaint filed by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The government alleged that the two men bribed officials in the Nigeria Customs Service to grant and then to extend temporary permits to allow offshore oil rigs to enter Nigerian waters and then continue operating beyond their original permit period, without the necessity of exporting and re-importing the equipment, which would have involved tremendous cost in terms of lost work, in addition to Nigerian customs duties. The SEC claims that the two men arranged and facilitated the payment of hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to obtain about 11 illicit permits and 29 permit extensions.  Ruehlen allegedly prepared false documents and paid the bribes, while Jackson approved and concealed the payments. In a separate complaint also filed on 24 February 2012, the SEC alleges that O'Rourke aided and abetted violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls sections of the Securities and Exchange Act, and that he directly violated false records and internal controls provisions of the Act.  O'Rourke agreed to the entry of a court order imposing a USD 35,000 penalty and permanently enjoining him from violations of the Act, although he neither admitted nor denied the allegations.On 8 May 2012, Ruehlen and Jackson filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them, based on the failure of the government to state a claim, and on the statute of limitations.  The substantive claim for both men rests on the theory that the payments made to officials were ""facilitation payments"" and therefore legal within the meaning of the FCPA.  The motions also claim that the complaint does not identify in sufficient detail the Nigerian officials who allegedly received bribes.On 22 June 2012, the SEC filed a combined answer to Jackson's and Ruehlen's motions to dismiss.  The answer cites precedent rejecting the facilitation payments argument, and notes that with respect to the statute of limitations argument, a tolling agreement is on file and acknowledged by the defendants, and in any event some of the corrupt conduct took place within the five-year statute of limitations (the lawsuit was filed on 24 February 2012, and the conduct alleged took place between September 2004 and May 2007).  Moreover, since some of the relief requested by the SEC is injunctive and therefore equitable relief, the statute of limitations does not apply.  The answer also rejects the defendants' claim that the bribe recipients are insufficiently identified, since government agencies and positions of employment are specified.On 11 December 2012, District Judge Keith P. Ellison ruled on Jackson and Ruehlen's motions to dismiss.  Judge Ellison granted Jackson's motion as to all claims insofar as the SEC seeks monetary penalties, but denied Jackson's motion insofar as the SEC seeks injunctive relief.  Ruehlen's motion to dismiss was granted as to violations that occurred prior to 24 February 2007, but denied as to claims that arose thereafter.  Furthermore, the judge denied Ruehlen's motion as to the SEC's complaint for injunctive relief (since in that case the five-year statute of limitations does not apply).  In January 2013, Judge Ellison set 28 April 2014 as the date for the trial. On 26 March 2013, Main Justice reported that the SEC, in an effort to avoid additional statute of limitations problems, has amended its complaint to exclude allegations occurring before 10 May 2006. According to the SEC, this date is the sum of the five years prior to the filing of the original complaint in February 2012 plus 290 days (which the SEC says the defendants agreed to as part of a tolling agreement). Jackson and Ruehlen have until 19 April 2013 to respond to the amended complaint.On 25 March 2014, the SEC dropped internal controls charges in a civil foreign bribery case against Mr. Jackson and Mr. Ruehlen, a current and a former executive at Noble Corp.  In a court filing, the SEC said it dropped allegations they violated internal-controls claims â€œto narrow this case and streamline the presentation of evidence to the jury.â€ùOn 1 July 2014, federal district judge Keith B. Ellison denied motions for summary judgments filed by the SEC, and by former Noble executives Mark Jackson and James Ruehlen.  According to the docket, all deadlines in the SEC's enforcement action against two former Noble executives have been vacated ""pending final settlement documents,"" indicating that the two defendants are planning to settle with the SEC.On 3 July 2014, Mark Jackson and James Ruehlen entered into a settlement with the SEC without financial penalty.  While the settlement contained injunctions against the two, it did not restrict current or future employment and contained no admission of wrongdoing.Nigeria EnforcementOn 13 January 2011, it was reported that Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had detained twelve oil-industry employees, including four Noble employees, in connection with the agency's investigation into the bribery scheme.

The company appealed against the conviction and on appeal the fine was increased to ZAR 12 million. In 2006, Lahmeyer was debarred from World Bank contracts for a seven-year term.  In August 2011, two years ahead of schedule, the World Bank removed Lahmeyer from its list of illegible firms in recognition of the company's improved compliance efforts.In 2003, Jacobus Michiel Du Plooy, an intermediary acting behalf of Impregilo, which was the lead partner of the consortium that built the main dam in the project, pleaded guilty to paying bribes to Sole on behalf of Impregilo. In exchange for cooperation with prosecutors, the High Court fined Du Plooy ZAR 500,000 and sentenced him to a conditionally suspended prison term.In 2004, Spie Batignolles (now Schneider Electric SA), the multinational French construction company responsible for building the transfer tunnels in the project, pleaded guilty to sixteen counts of bribery.

He has since been extradited to Canada to face charges there.On 13 April 2012, SNC-Lavalin announced that the RCMP had conducted another raid on its offices in connection with an investigation of ""certain individuals who are no longer employed by the Company."" The press report went on to say that the SNC-Lavalin is cooperating fully with the authorities but cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.In November 2012, Swiss prosecutors allegedly questioned Sami Bebawi, who served as manager of construction at SNC-Lavalin until January 2007.On 26 November 2012, Swiss authorities extended Riadh Ben Aissa's detention, as they sought to learn the destination of USD 139 million in funds deposited by SNC-Lavalin into accounts at a private bank, EFG, in Geneva.  According to a 25 November 2012 report in CBC News, Ben Aissa has been indicted in Switzerland on charges of money laundering and corruption.  CBC News also reports that a Swiss attorney associated with Ben Aissa (Roland Kaufmann) has been charged with money laundering and corruption for having set up two companies (Dinova and Duvel Securities) in the British Virgin Islands, which were involved in the money transfers.  CBC News says that a joint investigation is underway involving Canadian and Swiss authorities.  On 20 August 2014, Mr. Ben Aissa agreed to a deal with Swiss prosecutors that could lead to his extradition.  Switzerlandâ€™s Attorney-General's office said that Mr. Ben Aissa signed a plea deal with prosecutors on 4 August 2014, and a Swiss court is expected to rule on the plea deal in October.On 21 February 2013, Reuters reported that the Swiss authorities have extended their investigation to include SNC-Lavalin agent Farid Bedjaoui.  TunisiaVarious media reports in April 2012 revealed that SNC-Lavalin is under investigation by the Tunisian Commission of Inquiry into Corruption and Embezzlement regarding a CAD 320 million contract the company was awarded in 2010 with an Italian partner, Ansaldo Energia.India On 25 February 2011, it was reported that the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Special Court had again issued a summons to SNC-Lavalin in connection with the corruption scandal in India's Kerala state.  The court reportedly has also issued an arrest warrant for Klaus Triendl, former Senior Vice President at SNC-Lavalin, and initiated steps to extradite him to India. According to press reports, the CBI's ""SNC-Lavalin case"" is ongoing.  According to these reports, on 11 July 2012, the CBI presented documentation to the Kerala court substantiating efforts taken to effect the extradition of Klaus Triendl, including contacts with the Union Minister of External Affairs, the High Commission of India in Canada and the Canadian Police authorities.  In 2013, the Kerala court reportedly split the trial between Klaus Triendl and CPI state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan.Canada On 3 September 2011, it was reported that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (""RCMP"") had initiated an investigation into the Company regarding alleged corruption involving a USD 1.2 billion World Bank loan for a USD 2.9 billion bridge project in Bangladesh and had executed several raids in Ontario.  In a press release on 6 September 2011, SNC-Lavalin confirmed the investigation.   On 11 April 2012, Mohammed Ismail, Director of International Projects at SNC-Lavalin Toronto and Ramesh Shah, former Vice President at SNC-Lavalin Toronto were charged with one count of violating the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act (""CFPOA"").  The two men appeared in a Toronto court on 25 June 2012 in order to set a date for their preliminary hearing, which will take place in 2013.On 28 November 2012, the L'Unite permanente anticorruption (""UPAC""), Quebec's anti-corruption unit, announced that its Investigation Service had arrested Pierre Duhaime, former Chief Executive Officer of SNC-Lavalin, at his home that morning, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud, fraud and use of false documents.  In the same press statement, UPAC announced that mutual assistance proceedings are underway between UPAC and authorities in Switzerland regarding Riadh Ben Aissa.The Star reported that Pierre Duhaime was formally charged with fraud on 11 February 2013, to which he pleaded not guilty.In September 2013, the RMPC charged Kevin Wallace, former Senior Vice President of SNC-Lavalin International Inc, Zulfiquar Ali Bhuiyan, a Canadian citizen with ties to business in Bangladesh and Abul Hasan Chowdrey, a prominent Bangladeshi lobbyist, have been charged for violating Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act related to the company's failed bid to oversee the building of the Padma Bridge in Bangladesh. Two lower-level SNC-Lavalin employees await trial in Toronto for similar allegations. On 21 January 2014, the RCMP in Montreal filed criminal charges against two former senior SNC-Lavalin executives. Mr. Roy, a former vice-president at SNC-Lavalin, was charged with fraud, bribing a foreign public official, and contravening a United Nations economic measures act related to Libya.  Mr. Bebawi was charged with fraud, two counts of laundering the proceeds of a crime, four counts of possession of property obtained by crime and one count of bribing a foreign public official.On 10 September 2014, police in Canada charged Mr. Kyres, a prominent lawyer who formerly headed the tax practice at the Montreal office of Dentons Canada LPP, for an alleged plot against a potential witness in connection with the SNC-Lavalin probe. Mr. Kyres was charged  with extortion and obstruction of justice, according to the Globe and Mail.  Mr. Kyres allegedly approached undercover police to obtain a statement from Riadh Ben Aissa, a former vice president of SNC-Lavalin who was in jail in Switzerland for money laundering, fraud, and corruption.  Sami Bebawi, another former senior SNC executive, was also charged with obstruction of justice on 10 September 2014. SNC Lavalin, claiming it was duped by its own executives, will recoup more than USD $13 million that was recovered in a bribery probe by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.On 19 February 2015, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) National Division charged SNC Lavalin Group Inc., its division SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. and its subsidiary SNC-Lavalin International Inc. with violating the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA). The charges relate to CAN$47,689,868 (US$37,946,982) in alleged bribe payments made to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2013. A second count is for fraud of approximately CAN$130-million (US$103-million) related to construction projects in Libya, including the Great Man Made River Project.  BangladeshThe Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission (""ACC"") initiated an investigation of the matter.  On 2 July 2012, the ACC questioned Ziaul Haque, a local agent of SNC-Lavalin.  In a World Bank press release dated 20 September 2012, it is noted that the World Bank ""believes"" the Bangladeshi government to have put all officials suspected of involvement in the alleged corruption on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. The Chairman of the ACC, Ghulam Rahman, alleged on 27 November 2012 that ""[a]ttempts of bribery were made regarding the appointment of a consultant for the [Padma Bridge Project].""  Rahman also noted that World Bank investigators, who had visited Bangladesh in October, would return in early December 2012.Unconfirmed media reports on 18 December 2012 alleged that the ACC planned to issue a report accusing the former president of Candu Energy Inc. of conspiracy to bribe government officials. On 20 September 2012, the World Bank announced the conditional resumption of funding of the Padma Bridge Project.  Measures demanded by the World Bank include the introduction by Bangladesh of new procurement arrangements, with better oversight and transparency.  Bangladesh was also required to commit to the conduct of a ""full and fair"" investigation into the corruption allegations, and to allow the results of the investigation to be reviewed by an external panel, which will report its findings both to the Bangladeshi government and the World Bank.However, Bangladesh withdrew its request for World Bank funding for the Padma Bridge Project on 31 January 2013. The World Bank said on 1 February 2013 that Bangladesh's ""letter to the World Bank confirms the authorities' intent to continue the investigation of alleged corruption related to the project. The World Bank has taken note of the government's decision of not seeking renewed World Bank financing for the Padma Bridge, and it encourages the Anti-Corruption Commission to complete a full and fair investigation of the corruption allegations.""AlgeriaAccording to a CBC News report from 3 June 2013, police searched SNC-Lavalin's offices in Algiers. SNC-Lavalin's spokeswoman told CBC News that ""the authorities have given us no details"" about the investigation and that it ""included a search of our offices with which we co-operated in order to assist the authorities to obtain whatever information is needed to resolve the matters in question.""FranceThe investigation is ongoing.World Bank On 2 April 2012, the Company reported in a press release that ""one of its subsidiaries received formal notice from the World Bank that the rights of that subsidiary to bid on new World Bank projects have been temporarily suspended."" (By agreement, the other developments banks that were committed to funding portions of the project followed the World Bank suspension:  the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had pledged USD 610 million, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had committed USD 400 million and the Islamic Development Bank had promised USD 140 million.)   SNC-Lavalin acknowledged that the World Bank had issued an ""Early Temporary Suspension"" (""ETS"").  Under the World Bank's Sanctions Procedures, an ETS may be issued prior to the conclusion of an investigation by the Bank's integrity vice presidency, if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a sanctionable practice has occurred, and that the appropriate sanction for such misconduct is a minimum of two years' debarment. A temporary suspension prevents a company from being awarded new World Bank-financed contracts for an initial period of six months, subject to possible extension for an additional six months.On 29 June 2012, the World Bank issued the following press statement: ""The World Bank has credible evidence corroborated by a variety of sources which points to a high-level corruption conspiracy among Bangladeshi government officials, SNC Lavalin executives and private individuals in connection with the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project.  The World Bank provided evidence from two investigations to the Prime Minister, as well as the Minister of Finance and the Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission of Bangladesh (ACC) in September 2011 and April 2012. We urged the authorities of Bangladesh to investigate this matter fully and, where justified, prosecute those responsible for corruption.  We did so because we hoped the Government would give the matter the serious attention it warrants.  In Canada, where SNC Lavalin's headquarters are located, after executing numerous search warrants and a year-long investigation based on a referral from the World Bank, the Crown Prosecution Services brought corruption charges against two former SNC executives in connection with the Padma Bridge Project.""On 17 April 2013, the World Bank announced that it reached a settlement with SNC-Lavalin Inc. regarding allegations of misconduct in two World Bank projects. The settlement includes a 10-year debarment for SNC-Lavalin Inc. and over 100 of its affiliates. These companies have been barred from bidding on World Bank-financed projects for the 10-year period due to ""the company's misconduct in relation to the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in Bangladesh, as well as misconduct under another Bank-financed project."" The press release stated that the other project is the Rural Electrification and Transmission Project in Cambodia. The period of debarment can be reduced to eight years based on the Company's compliance with the debarment agreement. It is important to note that this debarment does not include all SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. subsidiaries and affiliates. SNC-Lavalin Inc. and these 100-plus affiliates represent a significant portion of the Group's business, but not all of it. Subsidiaries and affiliates of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. that are not included in the debarment may still bid for World Bank projects provided that they comply with the relevant rules and procedures.",A2WGW5Y3ZFBDEC,I can't tell,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,No,no_agreement,2015-04-17 04:11:35 UTC,,Yes3L1EFR8WWT5ET4O4B90RZ50UGX69FT,261,ARGENTINAThe investigation appears to be ongoing.

He pleaded guilty to one charge of fraud in 2003 and was sentenced to four years in prison; he served four months of his sentence.  The charge of corruption was dropped as a result of the plea bargain. Michael Woerfel, former Managing Director of EADS South Africa, was arrested and charged with corruption related to providing discounts on luxury vehicles to South African officials including Tony Yegeni. The charges against Mr. Woerfel were dropped in 2003 because the government had dropped the same charge against Mr. Yegeni. Schabir Shaik, former Director of Thomson-CSF South Africa Party Ltd. and a number of other companies including the Nboki group of companies, was convicted on June 2, 2005 on two charges of corruption and one charge of fraud.

On October 18, 2010, it was reported that the Police's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation had formally closed the investigation based on the lack of admissible evidence.

Angela Aguilar was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering.

Enrique Aguilar was charged with the conspiracy to violate the FCPA and substantive FCPA violations, while Enrique and Angela Aguilar each were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering.

SEC InvestigationInitially, the media reported allegations an Allianz joint venture paid bribes to win contracts to insure big infrastructure projects in Indonesia and whether the printing equipment maker paid bribes in Europe and elsewhere.  But prosecuting the potential violations proved very difficult for the SEC: although Allianz Capital Partners owns a majority stake in manroland AG (about 60%), the holdings are passive, and Allianz does not exercise day-to-day control and therefore, under  German law, cannot compel manroland to give documents to the SEC. Moreover, since the entity that allegedly paid the bribes in Indonesia is a Swiss subsidiary of Allianz' German subsidiary, the corporate connection between the companies is further removed.  And even Allianz is no longer listed on a U.S. stock exchange. On 17 December 2012, the SEC charged Allianz with FCPA books and records and internal controls violations, based on Allianz' alleged payments to Indonesian officials over the course of seven years.  Utama, a majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz, made improper payments to foreign officials to obtain or retain government insurance contracts, and recorded the payments as legitimate transaction costs. Since Utama's financial statements were consolidated into Allianz's financial statement, Allianz violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to keep accurate books, records and accounts.  Allianz also failed to devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that improper payments were not being made by its subsidiary, thereby violating Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls.In its Offer accompanying the SEC Cease and Desist Order, the Company agreed to pay USD 5,315,649 in disgorgement and USD 1,765,125 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of USD 5,315,649.",AS9E0S6DBSWH7,No,A35DS4T8H1MWYD,Yes,No,no_agreement,2015-04-17 04:02:23 UTC,,Yes3ZXV7Q5FJBOGR2V7NTAI1V12MI9CFD,317,The investigation appears to be ongoing.

On 14 March 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported that police in the UK had arrested four journalists, bringing the total number of arrests of journalists and police officers in the UK's investigation of News Corp. to 116. The Wall Street Journal reported on the same day that prosecutors announced plans to charge one police officer, James Bowes, for releasing information in exchange for money. On 20 March 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported that Geoff Webster, deputy editor of The Sun (a News Corp. tabloid), had been charged with two offenses of ""conspiring to commit misconduct in public office."" The charges stem from allegations that Webster authorized bribes to police officers in order to acquire information. The Guardian reported on 24 April 2013 that Duncan Larcombe, chief royal correspondent for The Sun, was charged with bribing a sergeant of a British military academy (where Prince Harry and Prince William had spent part of their military training) and his wife in order to acquire information about the royal family. The Guardian said that 34 bribes totaling approximately GBP 23,000 were allegedly made between 2006 and 2008.

The jury was unable to reach a verdict, and a retrial will begin in June 2015.On 5 November 2014, a former journalist for News of the World was convicted of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. The charges against the journalist were related to his or her payments to a prison officer for information about a murderer. That person's identity cannot be disclosed for legal reasons.On 16 January 2015, Mr. John Edwards and Mr. Troup were acquitted by a jury at Kingston crown court of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office.  Mr. Troup had been charged with paying an unknown prison official at HMP Whitemoor in November 2007 for a story about a suicide there.  During the trial, it emerged that the four-paragraph story had not been written by Mr. Troup, and there was no evidence as to whether the payment was made.Mr. Edwards was cleared of two charges: that he conspired with Pharo, Pyatt and Oâ€™Driscoll over payments to the Surrey police officer Simon Quinn, and that he was involved with them in a second conspiracy in connection with leaks from Broadmoor high-security hospital.On 20 March 2015, Fregus Shanahan, executive editor of The Sun (a News Corp. subsidiary), Geoff Webster, the Sun's deputy editor, John Kay, the Sun's former chief reporter, and Duncan Larcombe, a reporter, were found not guilty of charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.

Two men were arrested and are being interviewed.  Two search warrants were also executed in Spain by the Spanish authorities in relation to three British nationals.  In addition six search warrants were executed on residential premises in Australia.""Information gained from these searches and arrests led, in July and August 2011, to the arrest of nine former executives of the two RBA subsidiaries, who were formally charged with conspiring to bribe foreign public officials, under Australia's criminal code; they were also accused of false accounting.On 27 October 2011, both companies, NPA and Securency, entered guilty pleas at the Melbourne Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday to three charges each of bribing or conspiring to bribe foreign officials to obtain a business advantage.  The charges involve fines of about USD 13,000 per count.  Six months later, on 12 March 2012, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) released a statement saying that it did not intend to prosecute  Securency for securities offenses such as breach of fiduciary duty by company directors. ASIC refused to comment further on the case. Prosecution of IndividualsOn 18 July 2012, David John Ellery, who served as Securencyâ€™s CFO, pleaded guilty to a charge of false accounting in relation to a AUD 79,502 payment to Kuala Lumpur arms broker Abdul Kayum Syed Ahmad.  Specifically, Ellery admitted that he created a false document to facilitate a payment to Kayum even though he knew the latter  was not entitled to it.  Ellery is one of nine individuals to have been indicted by the Australian Federal Police.  In accepting his guilty plea, the Victoria Supreme Court acknowledged Ellery's willingness to testify against the eight remaining defendants.  Ellery's counsel noted that his client had not been involved in a wider conspiracy, and falsified documents at the behest of his superiors, and even that Ellery had warned senior colleagues at Securency that Kayum was not entitled to any money from the company. Following a hearing on 18 July 2012, the Supreme Court of Victoria (Melbourne) issued a sentencing judgment on 20 August 2012.  Ellery's offenses could invoke a maximum 10 year prison sentence.  The judge went to great lengths to explain Ellery's offense and the court's reasoning.  Ellery approved a commission payment to Kayum in Malaysia of AUD 79,502.  Later, when an invoice fabricated by Kayum reflected the same amount but showed an itemized list of ""expenses,"" Ellery forwarded it for payment.  When questioned about the ""expenses"" subsequently, Ellery concealed the nature of the payment.  In his favor, the judge noted that Ellery did not create the false document, did not at first wish to approve it, ultimately approved it without any idea of personal gain.  When confronted, Ellery pleaded guilty early in the proceedings, and agreed to cooperate in ongoing investigations both of Securency and NPA offenses in Malaysia and other jurisdictions.The judge therefore sentenced Ellery to 6 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, meaning that the sentence could be imposed if, at any time during the coming two years, Ellery commits another offense punishable by imprisonment.Amended charge sheets were issued against 8 individuals on 14 August 2012:  Anderson, Boillot, Brady, Curtis, Gerathy, Hutchinson, Leckenby and  Marchant.  A summary of the charges follows:Mitchell Anderson â€“ Charged with conspiring between December 1999 and June 2000 in one instance, and February 2001 in another instance, to confer a benefit on another person when such benefit was not legitimately due him, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties in order to obtain or retain business with the Bank of Indonesia.Christian Boillot and Barry Brady â€“ Charged with conspiring between October 2001 and December 2003 to offer to provide a benefit to another person to whom such benefit was not legitimately due, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties in order to obtain or retain business with Bank Negara Malaysia.Myles Curtis â€“ Charged with conspiring between December 1999 and June 2000 in one instance, and February 2001 in another instance,  to confer a benefit on another person when such benefit was not legitimately due him, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties in order to obtain or retain business with the Bank of Indonesia.Curtis is also charged with conspiring between October 2001 and December 2003 to offer to provide a benefit to another person to whom such benefit was not legitimately due, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties in order to obtain or retain business with Bank Negara Malaysia.Curtis is also charged with conspiring between January 2001 and September 2004, and again between January and October 2003, with offering to provide a benefit to a person when not legitimately due to that person, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties, in order to obtain or retain business with the State Bank of Vietnam.Curtis is also charged with dishonestly falsifying documents made or required for an accounting purpose (by concurring in the making of a false debit note), between June and July 2006, with a view to gain for another.Clifford Gerathy â€“ Charged with conspiring between January 2001 and September 2004, and again between January and October 2003, with offering to provide a benefit to a person when not legitimately due to that person, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties, in order to obtain or retain business with the State Bank of Vietnam.Gerathy is also charged with dishonestly falsifying documents made or required for an accounting purpose (by concurring in the making of a false debit note), between June and July 2006, with a view to gain for another.Peter Hutchinson â€“ Charged with conspiring between December 1999 and February 2001 to confer a benefit on another person when such benefit was not legitimately due him, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties in order to obtain or retain business with the Bank of Indonesia.John Leckenby â€“ Charged with conspiring between December 1999 and February 2001 to confer a benefit on another person when such benefit was not legitimately due him, with the intention of influencing a foreign public official in the exercise of the officialâ€™s duties in order to obtain or retain business with the Bank of Indonesia.

Finmeccanica had previously provided documentation in April and May, including documents regarding the Company's relationship with foreign suppliers and intermediaries.  According to the Half-year Report, on 3 July 2012, the Public Prosecutor of Naples' office issued a search warrant for the offices of the chairman of FATA SpA, in connection with a criminal investigation about the chairman's relationship with ""certain third parties.""  Earlier orders for production of documents focus on contracts entered into in 2010 between Finmeccanica and/or its group companies (AgustaWestland, SELEX Sistemi Integrati, and Telespazio Argentina) and the government of Panama. Likewise, earlier requests were made for documents involving relations with a consultancy company called VL Consulting, and a promoter called Agafia Corp. Prosecutors also investigated promotional expenses connected with Alenia Aeronautica and AnsaldoBreda, and the supply by Ansaldo of trains for the underground metrorail system in Fortaleza, Brazil.  Reuters reported on 23 October 2012 that Paolo Pozzessere, a former business manager at Finmeccanica (he resigned from his position when allegations first emerged) and current adviser to Finmeccanica, was arrested in Milan in connection with corruption allegations regarding the Company's contracts in Brazil and Panama.  On the same day, police searched offices in both Naples and Rome. Reuters also reported that former Minister of Industry (under Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) Claudio Scajola, is under investigation.On 24 March 2014, two former managers of Finmeccanica, Mr. Borgogni and Mr. Carlini, were placed under house arrest over allegations of international corruption connected to a tracking system for waste-hauling trucks.Public Prosecutor of MilanAccording to the Half-year Report, Ansaldo Energia SpA filed an appeal against a decision issued by the Milan Court on 20 September 2011 ordering the Company to pay an administrative fine of EUR 150,000.  A hearing is scheduled for 20 September 2012.  (Ansaldo Energia is 100% owned by Ansaldo Energia Holding, which in turn is 54.55% owned by Finmeccanica.)  The fine was imposed for bribery in the award of tenders.Reuters reported that the Public Prosecutor of Milan arrested Giuseppe Orsi, CEO and chairman of Finmeccanica, on 12 February 2013. Reuters also reported that three other people, including AgustaWestland CEO Bruno Spagnolini, were put under house arrest. The Wall Street Journal reported that Orsi's trial in Milan began on 19 June 2013.On 16 July 2014, an Italian judge issued arrest warrants for Christian Michell, a consultant based in Dubai, and Giuseppe Orsi, former chairman and CEO.  The judge declared the two fugitives and said the paperwork had been sent to their lawyers.Public Prosecutor of RomeAccording to the Half-year Report, in conjunction with the proceeding initiated against SELEX Sistemi Integrati, the prosecutor's office filed an attachment order against Electron Italia on 17 January 2012.  The order required the production of all agreements signed in 2009 between SELEX and Soluzioni di Business, a consulting company.  Electron Italia paid Soluzioni a flat sum of EUR 10,000 as ""the contractually agreed amount . . . by way of a lump-sum reimbursement of expenses.""  The Director of External Relations of SELEX was investigated; his employment was terminated on 7 December 2011.  The former chairman of Finmeccanica was also under investigation, and resigned on 1 December 2011.  The CEO of SELEX was investigated for bribery offenses, and tendered his resignation on 14 December 2011.  The Sales Manager of SELEX, also investigated for bribery, resigned on 13 December 2011. In an investigation into allegations of bribery in the assignment of projects by ENAV, the prosecutor's office issued a search warrant on 18 January 2012 to obtain contracts signed with Print Sistem and Electron Italia in 2009.  Additional warrants were issued on 8 March 2012 for 2009 contracts with ENAV.  On 23 April 2012, SELEX Sistemi Integrati was notified by the prosecutor's office of these document seizures. According to the Half-year Report, in February 2012, SELEX hired an expert, RINA Services, to investigate fairness in the allocation of contracts to Arc Trade, Print Sistem, Techno Sky, and Renco between January 2008 and November 2011.  Of the analyzed orders, orders or portions of orders totaling EUR 32 million (or 23% of the total) were found incongruent, whereas another portion of orders approximating EUR 16 million could not be analyzed because they are fixed-price orders. SELEX elected to proceed to an on-site analysis by RINA in October 2012.According to the Half-year Report, SELEX Sistemi Integrati commenced disciplinary proceedings in March 2012 against five employees, three of whom were terminated based on their conduct regarding the ENAV contracts.  (Electron Italia is 80% owned by SELEX Elsag SpA.  Digint Srl was at one time 49% owned by Finmeccanica Group Service, in turn wholly owned by Finmeccanica, and now renamed SELEX Elsag Cyberlabs, which is 49% owned by SELEX Elsag.)Public Prosecutor of L'Aquila According to the Half-year Report, criminal proceedings were initiated by the Aquila public prosecutor concerning orders placed between SELEX Service Management and Abruzzo Engineering (30% owned by SELEX).

The Civil Recovery Order issued by the High Court to settle the complaint filed by the SFO against OPL mandates the payment of Â£1,895,435 plus the costs of pursuing the order, Â£12,500, and imposes an independent monitor.  The monitor must be independent of OUP and its subsidiaries, must be appointed within 120 days, and must submit a report within 12 months.  If after receipt of the monitor's report and resolution of any issues raised therein, the SFO is satisfied that the ""Internal corporate policies, procedures and controls considered by the Independent Monitor meet the standards required by applicable English law and principles of good corporate governance in relation to a corporation operating in the UK,"" then the independent monitor will be discharged, and the trustee appointed by the court for oversight of the process shall also be discharged.The SFO's statement provides an explanation of how the penalty was calculated, and why the SFO elected to pursue a civil recovery order rather than a criminal penalty.  These reasons include:  lack of admissible evidence for a criminal process; the high cost and difficulty of conducting a criminal investigation abroad; the unlikelihood that cooperation by some of the foreign persons involved would be forthcoming; and finally, that ""a civil recovery disposal allows a better strategic deployment of resources to other investigations which have a higher probability of leading to a criminal prosecution.""

This means that the jurisdictions involved have not been victims as a result of overpaying for the goods or as a result being supplied goods which were unsuitable or not required.""  The SFO concludes that the terms of the settlement ""ensure all gross profit from any tainted contract will be disgorged.""OUP offered to contribute Â£2,000,000 to non-profit educational institutions in sub-Saharan Africa as part of the settlement with the SFO.
