Philip also authorized increased entertainment expenses in lieu of cash payments to its private and government-owned scrap metal customers.  As a result, Schnitzer Steel employees gave managers of the company's scrap metal customers additional gifts, including gift certificates worth $10,000 and a watch worth $2,400.After the internal investigation began, but before Schnitzer Steel had issued a directive to its employees to preserve documents related to the scrap metal transactions, Wooh authorized SSI Korea employees to destroy documents concerning the improper payments.During the period of the conduct, Schnitzer Steel provided no training or education to any of its employees, agents or subsidiaries regarding the requirements of the FCPA, nor had the company established a program to monitor its employees, agents and subsidiaries for compliance with the FCPA.Schnitzer Steel self-disclosed to the DOJ and SEC.",A2QLSHXNCHBRN4,Yes,2015-04-07 23:45:37 UTC33NKDW9FFXIXROMSNNG47219PDGXCF,2,AMERICAN BANK NOTE,"From 1996 through 1998, ABNH and Joshua Cantor, the former president and director of ABNH (and the former executive vice president of ABNH's parent, American Banknote Corporation (""ABN""), were involved in a scheme to fraudulently inflate the revenues and net income of ABNH and ABN in order to meet the earnings forecasts and condition the market for ABNH's initial public offering.

Locator Services, a Miami-based shell intermediary for three private telecommunications companies and Antonio Perez, former Controller at Terra Telecommunications Corp., a Miami-based telecommunications company, with conspiracy to violate the FCPA and money laundering laws in connection with over $1 million in improper payments made to former Haitian government officials.  [While court documents do not specifically identify Terra as one of the companies at issue, the company's identity was reported in the press.]Diaz was charged with conspiring to make corrupt payments to Haitian officials for the purpose of securing business advantages from Haiti's state-owned telecommunications company, Telecommunications D'Haiti (""Haiti Teleco""), on behalf of three different Miami-based telecommunications companies, including Terra.  He paid, and concealed payments of, over $1,028,851 to Haitian officials in his capacity as an intermediary for the three companies.  Diaz earned $73,824 in commissions for laundering the bribes.Perez was charged with conspiring to make corrupt payments to officials of Haiti Teleco on behalf of Terra.  He was Controller at the company from March 1998 through January 2002 and assisted the company in making improper payments to former Haitian officials, which totaled approximately $674,193 through the course of the conspiracy, which spanned from 1998 to 2005.  Perez assisted in paying $36,375 worth of side payments from November 2001 through January 2002 and helped conceal the payments through Diaz's shell company and by recording them as consulting services.  According to court documents, Terra and two other Miami-based telecommunications companies executed a series of contracts with Haiti Teleco so that the company's customers could place telephone calls to Haiti.  Diaz and Perez conspired with the companies to make side payments to the Director of International Relations and the Director General at Haiti Teleco at the time.  The side payments were made through a shell company owned by Diaz.  In exchange for the improper payments, the former Haitian officials provided the Miami-based telecommunications companies with a variety of business advantages, including preferential connection rates and various credits towards sums owed, such as reductions in the number of minutes for which payments were due.   In an indictment unsealed on December 7, 2009, five additional individuals were charged for their alleged roles in the foreign bribery, wire fraud and money laundering scheme, under which, between November 2001 and March 2005, Terra allegedly paid more than $800,000 to shell companies to be used for bribes to foreign officials of Haiti Teleco.Joel Esquenazi, President of Terra, and Carlos Rodriguez, former Executive Vice President at Terra, were indicted for conspiracy to violate the FCPA, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, substantive violations of the FCPA, conspiracy to commit money laundering and substantive counts of money laundering.  Robert Antoine and Jean Rene Duperval, two former Directors of International Relations at Haiti Teleco were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy and substantive counts of money laundering, respectively.  Marguerite Grandison, President of Telecom Consulting Services Corp., an intermediary for a Miami-based telecommunications company (and Duperval's sister) was charged with conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, substantive violations of the FCPA, conspiracy to commit money laundering and substantive counts of money laundering.  On February 1, 2010, a criminal information was filed against Jean Fourcand, President and Director of Miami-based Fourcand Enterprises Inc., alleging that, between November 2001 and August 2002, Fourcand received funds originating from U.S. telecommunications companies for the benefit of Haiti Teleco official Robert Antoine.  Various U.S. telecommunications companies sent money to Diaz, who then dispersed the funds by issuing J.D. Locator checks made payable to Fourcand Enterprises.   In one instance, Fourcand received a $18,500 check on February 20, 2002, drawn on J.D. Locator Service‰Ûªs bank account, which Fourcand deposited into a Fourcand Enterprises account.  The check contained a false invoice number to make the payment appear to be for legitimate services.  Fourcand then used the funds to facilitate a real estate transaction for the benefit of Robert Antoine. On July 13, 2011, a superseding indictment was filed in connection with the Haiti Teleco-related foreign bribery, wire fraud and money laundering scheme.  Cinergy Telecommunications Inc., a privately-held Florida telecommunications company, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and to commit wire fraud, six counts of FCPA violations, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and 19 counts of money laundering.  Washington Vasconez Cruz, the President of Cinergy and another Florida telecommunications company, Uniplex Telecommunications Inc., was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and to commit wire fraud, six counts of FCPA violations, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and 19 counts of money laundering.  Amadeus Richers, the then-director of Cinergy and Uniplex, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and to commit wire fraud, six counts of FCPA violations, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and 19 counts of money laundering.  Patrick Joseph, a former General Director for Telecommunications at Haiti Teleco, was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Jean Rene Duperval and Marguerite Grandison, who were previously charged in the initial December 2009 indictment, were each charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering and 19 counts of money laundering.  The DOJ described the alleged misconduct at issue in the superseding indictment as follows in its July 13, 2011 press release:""According to the superseding indictment, the defendants allegedly participated in a scheme to commit foreign bribery and money laundering from December 2001 through January 2006.   The indictment alleges that during this time period Cinergy and its related company, Uniplex Telecommunications Inc., allegedly paid more than $1.4 million to shell companies to be used for bribes to foreign officials of the Republic of Haiti‰Ûªs state-owned national telecommunications company, Telecommunications D‰ÛªHaiti (Haiti Teleco).According to court documents, Cinergy and Uniplex executed a series of contracts with Haiti Teleco that allowed the companies‰Ûª customers to place telephone calls to Haiti.   The bribe payments allegedly were authorized by Washington Vasconez Cruz, the telecommunications companies‰Ûª president, and Amadeus Richers, the companies‰Ûª director, and were allegedly paid to Haitian government officials at Haiti Teleco, including Patrick Joseph and Jean Rene Duperval.   According to the superseding indictment, the purpose of these bribes was to obtain various business advantages from the Haitian officials for Cinergy and Uniplex, including preferred telecommunications rates and credits toward sums owed.  To conceal the bribe payments, the defendants allegedly used various shell companies to receive and forward the payments, including J.D. Locator Services, Fourcand Enterprises and Telecom Consulting Services.""Esquenazi and Rodriguez were charged in the initial December 2009 indictment and are unaffected by the July 2011 superseding indictment.  A second superseding indictment was filed on 20 January 2012, against Cecilia Zurita, who had served as vice president of Cinergy and is married to  Vasconez Cruz.  Zurita is accused of writing checks to shell companies in order for the funds to be used to bribe Haitian officials.  The indictment alleges that over $2.9 million is subject to forfeiture.

According the SEC complaint, the Schering-Plough Poland manager arranged a total of 13 payments, some of which were structured to be below the manager's approval level.  In addition, the manager provided false justifications for the donations on documents he submitted to Schering-Plough's finance department, including describing the payments as covering fight against viral hepatitis, financing screening examinations to detect skin cancer, and support actions of Foundation in preventing infectious diseases of the liver.

The indictment charged Naaman with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and violate the FCPA and two counts of violating the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions.  According to the indictment, from 2001 to 2003, while acting on behalf of a publicly-traded U.S. chemical company with executive offices in the United Kingdom - understood to be Innospec Inc. - and its Swiss subsidiary, Naaman offered and paid 10% kickbacks to the Iraqi government in order to obtain five contracts under the Oil for Food Program.  In exchange for negotiating and handling the kickbacks, Naaman allegedly received a 2% commission for securing the contract as well as 2% of the contracts value.

During that period, Tyco acquired hundred of companies around the world in order to become a large, diversified manufacturing company involved in businesses such as fire protection and security systems, electrical and electronic components, healthcare and engineered products and services.  Included in the SEC complaint were charges that, from 1999 until 2002, two Tyco subsidiaries violated the FCPA.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that in 1998 Tyco acquired Multiservice Engenharia Ltda., which would become Earth Tech Brazil, despite the fact that pre-merger due diligence uncovered that improper payments to government officials were common in Brazil and were described as necessary in the industries in which Earth Tech Brazil operated.  After the acquisition, Earth Tech Brazil made numerous payments to various Brazilian officials in order to assist with its construction and operation of municipal water and wastewater treatment systems.  According to the SEC complaint, the payments were so widespread that 60% of Earth Tech Brazil's contracts during the relevant time period involved payments to government officials.  These payments were made through lobbyists retained for this purpose and false invoices from companies owned by Earth Tech Brazil employees were used to obtain the funds and conceal the payments, causing Tyco to maintain inaccurate books and records. In 1999, Tyco acquired Dong Bang, a fire protection services firm in South Korea.  Again, pre-merger due diligence revealed that improper payments to government officials were prevalent in the South Korean contracting business.  After the acquisition, Dong Bang executives allegedly provided entertainment to South Korean officials and made cash payments.  According to the complaint, Dong Bang's former president spent $32,000 on entertainment provided to various South Korean officials in 2001, and he frequently provided entertainment to South Korea's Minister of Construction and Finance and a South Korean military general in order to obtain business.  In 2002, a Dong Bang Executive paid $7,500 to an employee of a state-owned nuclear power plant in order to obtain a contract.  In order to make the payments, Dong Bang created fictitious employees whose payroll disbursements were wired to the company's executives.  This caused the company to maintain inaccurate books and records. The SEC noted that Tyco did not have an adequate or uniform FCPA compliance program to prevent illegal payments.  In addition, the complaint stated that Earth Tech and Dong Bang employees did not receive adequate training on FCPA compliance given the companys awareness that payments to government officials were prevalent in the industries in which the companies operated.

Starting in late 1979, Ashland Oil, Inc., through its subsidiary Ashland Development Inc., made USD 29 million in improper payments to James Langdon, a British Army officer seconded to Oman (and hence an official of Oman for purposes of the FCPA) in return for crude oil contracts from Oman's government.  ADI began investing in Midland Chrome Mines (Private) Ltd., a company in Zimbabwe owned by Langdon and his family.  Over the next few years, ADI made approximately USD 25 million in payments and USD 4 million in interest by acquiring a 75% ownership interest in Midland Mines.  The mines themselves, due to a hostile political atmosphere in Zimbabwe and technical problems in removing the minerals, among other reasons, ultimately proved a worthless investment.  In return for the payments, Langdon used his influence with the Sultan of Oman to aid Ashland Oil in the procurement of crude contracts at a reduced price.  Central in these negotiations was Atkins, who approved many of the payments and proceeded with the dealings despite warnings from company lawyers and managers about possible FCPA violations.

The Niger Air Force, the Escardrille Nationale Nigerienne (""ENN""), however, could not come up with the required funds.  Not wanting to loose this potential business, Dornier established a relationship with NAPCO so that the Niger government could tap into the FMS funds.  From 1983-1987, the U.S. government approved three purchase orders worth approximately USD 3.2 million for aircraft parts for two airplanes owned by the Niger Air Force.  During the course of their relationship with the government of Niger, NAPCO's primary contacts were Tahirou Barke Doka, a Niger official serving as a Counselor in their Washington, D.C. embassy, and Captain Ali Tiemogo, the Chief of Maintenance for the Niger Air Force.The first contract, approved in December 1983, was worth USD 681,000.  In order to facilitate this order, NAPCO paid approximately USD 39,000 in bribes to Barke and Tiemogo through a fictitious sales agent, known as ""E. Dave,"" with a bank account in Minnesota which was controlled by Barke.   The second contract, agreed upon in August 1984, was worth USD 1,000,000.  NAPCO ended its ""relationship"" with E. Dave at this time and employed a different ""sales agent,"" the brother-in-law of Tiemogo, Amadou Mailele.  For the duration of the contract, at total of USD 49,000 in payments were made to Mailele and deposited in a Paris bank account.

In the following years, ACL received a number of add-on contracts and contract modifications, including the Contract Engineering Technical Services (‰ÛÏCETS‰Ûù) contract.  These contracts generated approximately $64 million in revenue and $8.6 million in profit from 1999 until 2004, or one-third of ACL‰Ûªs gross revenue for that period. According to the SEC complaint, in 1996, Thomas Wurzel, ACL‰Ûªs president, hired a retired Egyptian Air Force general to act as an agent to help move the F-16 depot project forward. The consultant began receiving a monthly fee of $4,000. The company allegedly did not conduct any due diligence on the consultant until March 1998, when his consulting fee was increased to $20,000 per month. The consultant‰Ûªs company allegedly continued to receive payment from ACL even after the contract was awarded in 1999, in order to help the company obtain additional business related to the F-16 depot.  In addition to assisting ACL win new business, the Egyptian agent began acting as a labor contractor in 2000 to coordinate the labor needed for the project.  He was reimbursed for these services after submitting monthly invoices, which ranged from $4,300 to $11,000 per month. This contract was separate from the consulting contract. By mid-2001, the agent‰Ûªs contract had expired and was not renewed because ACL had satisfied its obligations; however, the agent continued to receive a number of payments from ACL because Wurzel had allegedly agreed to continue paying the consulting fee.  During early 2001, ACL began working toward winning the CETS contract, which involved providing personnel to provide technical assistance at the Air Force base where the depot was being constructed. The Egyptian agent assisted ACL with winning this contract.

According to SEC documents, the agent specifically requested that these funds not be deducted from his labor support contract. One such payment was made by using an invoice for an advance payment of rental equipment.  ACL was awarded five additional CETS contracts between 2002 and 2004.

IraqThe Oil-for-Food Program was established by the United Nations (""UN"") to enable Iraq to sell its oil for humanitarian purposes, in the context of an extensive international sanctions regime. The Oil-for-Food Program mandated that the proceeds of oil sales be deposited in a UN bank account and that those proceeds be used by the Iraqi government only to purchase humanitarian goods and services, such as food and medicine, approved by the UN. Beginning in 2000, the former Iraqi government began requiring companies wishing to sell humanitarian goods to government ministries to pay a kickback, often mischaracterized as an ""after sales services fee,"" to the government in order to be granted a contract. The amount of that fee was usually 10 percent of the contract price. Such payments were not permitted under the Oil-for-Food Program or other sanction regimes then in place.In its Form 20-F submission to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on 26 March 2012, Total said that ""certain current or former Group employees were placed under formal criminal investigation [in France] for possible charges as accessories to the misappropriation of corporate assets and as accessories to the corruption of foreign public agents.""

The secret accounts were allegedly in Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and elsewhere. Allegations linked BBVA to multibillion-dollar bank privatisations in the late 1990's in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Peru. The investigation began with a US FBI investigation into a whistleblower's allegations of money laundering at BBVA's Puerto Rico subsidiary and this led to claims that BBVA had US $227 million in secret accounts. A trail reportedly led from that account to Latin America. Judge Garzon stated in 2002 that he had not received solid responses to his formal requests for information from the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Puerto Rico, Jersey and the US state of Delaware. The case against BBVA had different areas of investigation. One of them concerned allegations of money laundering at BBVA's Puerto Rico subsidiary and was dismissed by Judge Grande Marlaska in March 2005, during a leave of absence of Judge Garzon (he was teaching in the USA). Judge Marlaska referred to the 'absolute lack of evidence' against the BBVA and supported his decision with an audit by KPMG and the testimony of BBVA executives.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that these payments were not recorded by the government in its accounting records and that none of the development projects has occurred. Furthermore, the article reports that multiple politicians and bureaucrats in Cambodia have publicly stated that the payments were bribes or payments akin to bribes, including one who said that the USD $2.5 million payment was ""tea money"" (a bribe) for the mining concession.BHP Billiton described the ongoing investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on 21 April 2010, saying that the investigation was related primarily to certain terminated minerals exploration projects regarding possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws. BHP Billiton disclosed in its Annual Report released on 22 December 2010 an internal investigation was commenced into possible misconduct involving interactions with government officials.  According to press reports, the Australian and UK authorities are investigating as well.On 13 March 2013, Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") is investigating allegations surrounding BHP Billiton's sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The allegations are that BHP Billiton provided ""inducements, hospitality and gifts"" to government officials from China and other countries. According to one source Reuters cited, among the officials that allegedly received the bribes were leaders from Chinalco (a Chinese state-owned aluminum producer) and the China Iron and Steel Association. The DOJ's investigation came to light after an information request carried out by Fairfax Media in Australia. Bloomberg News reported on 17 June 2013 that BHP Billiton provided evidence to Australian and U.S. authorities regarding the Beijing Olympics. In a Company press release dated 16 August 2013, BHP Billiton stated that ""the SEC and DOJ have recently notified the Group of the issues they consider could form the basis of enforcement actions and discussions are continuing.

In order to conceal Biomet's payment of about 15-20% of its sales of medical devices to publicly owned hospitals, the company used fake invoices from the doctors, charging for professional services which in fact were not rendered.  These payments were recorded as ""consulting fees"" or ""commissions.""  In 2000, the tax law changed, and no untaxed payments to doctors were allowed, so Biomet began recording the payments as ""royalties"" or ""other sales and marketing.""  Biomet executives and auditors allegedly were aware of this practice, and took no steps to check the transactions.   In February 2006, Biomet's Latin America Auditor sent an internal report to the Senior Vice President, the Operations Manager, and other executives and managers, stating that allegations concerning ""fraudulent product registration certificates, bribery of customs officials"" were being investigated by Biomet, and that it had been determined ""that certificates were fraudulent and bribes were made.""In November 2006, the Latin America Auditor recommended that payments to the doctors  that were labeled ""commission expenses"" on the company records should be changed to ""royalties."" And even after the Company received a letter from the SEC regarding payments in other jurisdictions, it continued to make improper payments to surgeons in Argentina and reflect the 15-20% commissions in its accounting records.  However, in August 2008 the Company distributed new compliance guidelines, and this precipitated a suspension of all sales in Argentina.BRAZILBiomet sold its devices in Brazil through Biomet International, which engaged a distributor (""Brazilian Distributor"") to pay bribes to physicians employed by public hospitals, as an inducement for them to buy Biomet medical implants.  At least as early as 2001, Biomet allegedly knew of these payments.  In February 2002, for example, the Director of Internal Audit stated in a memorandum to Biomet's Senior Vice President and Operations Manager: ""Brazilian Distributor makes payments to surgeons that may be considered as a kickback.  These payments are made in cash that allows the surgeon to receive income tax free . . . The accounting entry is to increase a prepaid expense account.  In the consolidated financials sent to Biomet, these payments were reclassified to expense in the income statement.""  In April 2008, Biomet had accountants and outside counsel perform due diligence on Brazilian Distributor, in anticipation of Biomet's purchase of the latter.  The due diligence revealed ""cash payments to doctors and debit card purchases on behalf of doctors that raised red flags of bribery.""  Biomet terminated its relationship with Brazilian Distributor, and temporarily ceased selling its products on the Brazilian market.  The Company wrote off USD 4.2 million in accounts receivable owed to it by the distributor.According to a Form 8-K filed by Biomet on 17 March 2015, Biomet became aware of other alleged improprieties in it's Brazil operations in October 2013. CHINABiomet sold its medical devices in China through subsidiaries Biomet China and Scandimed.  They used the Chinese Distributor to pay bribes to doctors employed in publicly owned hospitals, beginning at least in 2001.  The Chinese Distributor called the bribe payments ""rebates"" of 10-15%.  In February 2001, Scandimed wrote to Biomet's president of International Operations in Indiana, as well as Biomet employees in the UK that ""as we understand it, giving commission [sic] or gifts of various kinds to surgeons is common in China,"" eliciting a response about sales margins from the President of International Operations.  The benefits conferred upon doctors in China included travel, as evidenced in a May 2001 email from Chinese Distributor to Biomet's  Associate Regional Manager explaining how to overcome objections by a particular doctor ""[Doctor] will become the most loyal customer of Biomet if we send him to Switzerland.""  Another email mentioned that doctor was the head of a department in a public hospital in Shanghai, and that ""many key surgeons in Shanghai are buddies of his...Dinner has been set for the evening of the 24th...But dinner aside, I've got to send him to Switzerland to visit his daughter.""  Some emails contain clear explanations of how the commissions were paid, as in one from the Chinese Distributor to the Associate Regional Manager, dated 21 April 2002:  ""When we say 'Surgeon Rebate included,' it means the invoice price includes a predetermined percentage for the surgeon.  For example, a vendor invoices the hospital for a set of plate & screws at RMB 3,000.00.  The vendor will have to deliver RMB 750.00 (25% in this case) in cash to the surgeon upon completion of surgery [sic].""  Emails from 2005 indicate that payments made to doctors in connection with clinical trials were recorded in the Company's books as ""entertainment,"" and that doctors conducting clinical trials are paid a 10-15% ""consulting fee."" In 2006, Biomet elected to cut the Chinese Distributor out of its Chinese operations, and to use Biomet sales staff instead.  In October 2007, the Company paid for 20 Chinese surgeons to fly to Barcelona and Valencia for training, with ""a substantial portion of the trip"" devoted to sightseeing and entertainment.  In the same month, a product manager in Biomet China discussed ways to evade anti-corruption measures that had been taken by the Chinese government, noting ""Obviously, China government [sic] doesn't have ability to forbid the corruption from hospitals & surgeons.""  The product manager suggested falsifying invoices, among other methods.MEXICOAccording to a Form 8-K filed by Biomet on 3 July 2014, Biomet became aware of alleged improprieties in it's Mexico operations in October 2013.",AHP3TKMY58D8Z,No,2015-04-07 23:43:04 UTC3JU8CV4BRLCTR4H4R1FE8P9NCSRPOH,188,BLACKWATER (now ACADEMI),"According to press reports, in 2009 the DOJ launched an investigation into possible FCPA violations by Blackwater in connection with approximately USD 1 million in payments allegedly provided to Iraqi officials following the 2007 Nisour Square incident in which Blackwater security guards fatally shot 17 Iraqis.

On 20 December 2012, the SEC filed a complaint in which the following allegations are made.Poland AllegationsBeginning in 2000, the Company's wholly-owned  subsidiary in Poland (""Lilly-Poland"") negotiated contracts with various regional public health authorities, including the Silesian Health Fund, to supply public health facilities with specific pharmaceuticals from a list of approved products.  Gemzar, a cancer drug, became one of the approved products after Lilly-Poland's manager agreed to contribute to the Chudow Foundation, a charitable organization devoted to restoring castles in Silesia.  The Chudow Foundation was founded by and administered by the Director of the Silesian Health Fund.  Lilly-Poland eventually paid about USD 39,000 to the Chudow Foundation,in eight payments, which were falsely recorded in the requesting documentation as ""indirect support of educational efforts [of the Silesia Health Fund].""   The Complaint offers evidence that the payments were intended for the improper purpose of inducing the director of the Health Fund to agree to the purchase of Gemzar, and alleges that Lilly-Poland's Medical Grant Committee approved the payments to Chudow without analyzing the circumstances, such as the high-level government health official's involvement in both the Chudow Foundation and the Gemzar negotiations, and without questioning the proximity between the time of payment to the foundation and the date of the meeting at which the Company's drug was approved for purchase by the Health Fund, or the fact that the written justifications given for the payments were different, although the recipient was the same.  (In fact, the Chudow Foundation was alleged to be the recipient of improper payments by Schering Plough during approximately the same period; that company settled FCPA charges in 2004 without admitting or denying the allegations.)Russia AllegationsThe SEC's complaint alleges that the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary in Russia, Lilly-Vostok, entered into 96 ""marketing"" or ""service"" agreements with 42 third-parties selected by government officials.  The third-parties  received a percentage of drug sales or a flat fee in bank accounts located outside of Russia.  The agreements listed services such as ""immediate customs clearance"" or ""immediate delivery,"" ""obtaining payment for the sales transaction,"" ""promotion of products,"" or ""marketing research.""  Lilly-Vostok is alleged to have received no actual services pursuant to these contracts, and its employees are alleged to have deemed the payments as necessary for obtaining business with government entities.   Reports were sent to the Company's management in 1997 and 1999 which raised concerns about the contracts and recommended that internal controls be modified.  According to the complaint, despite these warning signs the Company did not limit the use of such agreements or make any effort to ensure that money was not being channeled to foreign officials by means of the agreements.  For example, in 2003 Lilly-Vostok paid  as much as 30% of sales to entities in Cyprus  that were owned and controlled by a member of the Russian Parliament who, according to the complaint, ""exercised considerable influence over government decisions relating to the pharmaceutical industry in Russia.""  Ultimately, Lilly-Vostok paid the Cypriot entities over USD 5.2 million.  Similar transactions involving a British Virgin Islands company resulted in Lilly-Vostok making 65 payments totaling USD 2 million that were channeled to the Director General of a Russian government entity.  These transactions continued until 2005.  China AllegationsSales representatives  and supervisors employed by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary in China, ""Lilly-China,"" allegedly submitted false expense reports between 2006 and 2009, and used the cash generated by the false reports to buy gifts such as wine and jewelery, and to pay for entertainment, meals and cosmetics for government-employed physicians.  The gifts are alleged to have been intended to induce doctors to prescribe the Company's products.Brazil AllegationsIn 2007, the Company's Brazilian subsidiary (""Lilly-Brazil"")  gave unusually large discounts to a pharmaceutical distributor.  The Company's pricing committee approved the discounts without adequate verification of the circumstances.  Sales of the highly discounted drugs totaled approximately USD 1.2 million.  The complaint alleges that the distributor used 6% of the purchase price to bribe government officials so that the public health facilities would purchase the Company's product.",A1NM7ZPZ3NH412,No,2015-04-07 23:39:35 UTC38O9DZ0A62N7ARAUP7I8VCF3GI562M,192,ENI / SNAMPROGETTI,"According to press reports, the Nigeria LNG bribery scandal first came to light during the course of investigations by French prosecutors into Elf-Aquitaine's operations in Asia and Africa.Eni described the (at the time ongoing) investigation as follows its 2009 Annual Report:""Snamprogetti Netherlands BV has a 25% participation in the TSKJ Consortium companies. The remaining participations are held in equal shares of 25% by Halliburton/KBR, Technip, and JGC. Beginning in 1994 the TSKJ Consortium has been involved in the construction of natural gas liquefaction facilities at Bonny Island in Nigeria. Snamprogetti SpA, the holding company of Snamprogetti Netherlands BV, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Eni until February 2006, when an agreement was entered into for the sale of Snamprogetti to Saipem SpA and Snamprogetti was merged into Saipem as of October 1, 2008. Eni holds a 43% participation in Saipem. In connection with the sale of  Snamprogetti to Saipem, Eni agreed to indemnify Saipem for a variety of matters, including potential losses and charges resulting from the investigations into the TSKJ matter referred to below, even in relation to Snamprogetti subsidiaries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), and other authorities, including the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan, are investigating alleged improper payments made by the TSKJ Consortium to certain Nigerian public officials. The proceedings in the US: beginning in June 2004, Eni and Saipem/Snamprogetti have been voluntarily providing information in response to requests by the SEC and the DoJ in connection with the investigations. In February 2009, KBR and its former parent company, Halliburton, announced that they had reached a settlement with the SEC and the DoJ with respect to the TSKJ matter as well as other unspecified matters. KBR/Halliburton pleaded guilty to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) charges, for the conduct stemming from their participation in TSKJ, and they have agreed to pay a criminal fine of $402 million to the DOJ and a civil penalty of $177 million to the SEC. In view of the agreements entered into by KBR/Halliburton with the DoJ and SEC, the TSKJ matter could result in legal liability on the part of individuals as well as the other members of the TSKJ Consortium Entities found in violation of the FCPA, and those entities could be subject to substantial fines and the imposition of ongoing measures by the US government to prevent future violations, including potentially a monitor of internal controls, and debarment from government contracts.""In a press release of February 12, 2010, the French company Technip announced, as a result of the circumstances that its discussions with US authorities have intensified over the last weeks, the recognition of a provision for an amount of ‰âÂ245 million reflecting the estimated cost of resolution with such Authorities.  The decision was made according to the status of ongoing discussions with DoJ and SEC that allowed Technip to estimate a global resolution of all potential claims against the company arising from the investigation. ""As to Eni, the contacts with the US authorities have been intensified recently.

""The proceedings in Italy: beginning in 2004, the TSKJ matter has prompted investigations by the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan against unknown persons. Since March 10, 2009, the company received requests of exhibition of documents by the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan. On July 17, 2009, the date on which a search and attachment warrant was served on Saipem/ Snamprogetti, the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan indicated to the company that it is investigating one or more people, including at least one former manager of Snamprogetti; previously, as far as the company knew, nobody was under formal investigation. The events under investigation cover the period since 1994 and also concern the period of time subsequent to the June 8, 2001 enactment of the Italian legislative decree n. 231 concerning the liability of legal entities. A violation of legislative decree June 8, 2001 n. 231 can result in the confiscation of criminal profits in addition to administrative penalties. During the preliminary investigations, the preventive attachment of such profits and other precautionary measures are possible. On July 31, 2009, a decree issued by the Judge for Preliminary Investigation at the Court of Milan was served on Saipem SpA (as legal entity incorporating Snamprogetti SpA). The decree sets for September 22, 2009 a hearing in Court in relation to a proceeding ex Legislative Decree no. 231 of June 8, 2001 whereby the Public prosecutor of Milan is investigating Eni SpA and Saipem SpA for liability of legal entities arising from offences involving international corruption charged to two former managers of Snamprogetti SpA. The Public Prosecutor of Milan requested Eni SpA and Saipem SpA to be debarred from activities involving ‰ÛÒ directly or indirectly ‰ÛÒany agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries. The above mentioned hearing allow Eni and Saipem to conduct own defence before any decision is made on the requested disqualification. The events referred to the request of precautionary measures of the Public Prosecutor of Milan cover TSKJ Consortium practices in the period from 1995 to 2004. To this regard, the Public Prosecutor claims the inadequacy and violation of the organizational, management and control Model adopted to prevent those offences charged to people subject to direction and supervision. At the time of the events under investigation, the company had adopted a code of practice and internal procedures with reference to the best practices at the time. Subsequently, such code and internal procedures have been improved aiming at the continuous improvement of internal controls. Furthermore, on March 14, 2008 Eni approved a new Code of Ethics and a new Model 231 reaffirming that the belief that one is acting in favour or to the advantage of Eni can never, in any way, justify ‰ÛÒ not even in part ‰ÛÒ any behaviours that conflict with the principles and contents of the Code. Since April 23, 2009, with regard to investigations on the TSKJ matter the Company's Board of Directors has timely recalled the analysis of the existing internal procedures against corruption, in order to implement any upgrading to be possibly needed, and to continue the cooperation with the relevant authorities and also resolved to promote all legal measures for protecting the Company's interests and reputation, in case the responsibility of its employees or collaborators is verified. The jury room of September 22, 2009 has been postponed to the hearing of October 21, 2009 when the judge for the preliminary investigation rejected the request of precautionary measures of disqualification filed by the Public Prosecutor of Milan against Eni and Saipem. The Public Prosecutor of Milan appealed the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigation. The hearing for the review of the appeal, scheduled initially for January 20, 2010 has been anticipated, through a measure communicated to the defence on January 12, 2010, on January 19, 2010 when the Judge of Re-examination dismissed as unfounded the appeal of the Public Prosecutor.

This offense applies when any person associated with the organization offers or accepts bribery anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain a business advantage for the organization or in the conduct of business. The Bribery Act has wide ranging implications in particular for business in the U.K., including GCUK and our other U.K. subsidiaries. However, it should be noted that it also has a wide-ranging extra-territorial effect. The Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the FCPA. Under the Bribery Act, it will be a defense to the accusation of failure to prevent bribery for a commercial organization to show that it had in place 'adequate procedures' designed to prevent such acts.

The Company further announced that the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors had engaged the law firm of Mayer Brown LLP, an international law firm with significant experience in investigating and advising on FCPA matters, to lead the investigation. The investigation is ongoing.""The Audit Committee began its internal investigation after management brought to the attention of the committee concerns about certain actions by a customs agent in connection with shipments of materials, obtaining temporary importation permits for its vessels into Nigeria, and the settlement of the FCPA proceedings involving certain Vetco Gray entities. In addition, the Company's management and the Audit Committee were aware of press releases by three other companies disclosing that they are conducting internal investigations into the FCPA implications of certain actions by a customs agent in connection with the temporary importation of their vessels into Nigeria. The Company's management considered it prudent to review the Company's operations since it uses customs agents and the Company's vessels that have operated in Nigeria do so under temporary importation permits.""The Company voluntarily contacted the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice to advise them that an independent investigation is under way and that it intends to cooperate fully with both agencies. The Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to the Company's dealings with the customs agent in question, focusing primarily on transactions in the Company's West African operations, which indicates that the SEC has opened a formal non-public investigation into the matter. The letter accompanying the SEC subpoena states that the investigation and subpoena do not mean that the SEC or its staff has concluded that any violation of law has occurred, nor does it mean that they have a negative opinion of any person, entity or security. The Company has been cooperating fully with both agencies in connection with the matter and will continue to do so. Special counsel to the Audit Committee for the investigation has and will continue to provide interim updates to the agencies and the Audit Committee as the investigation progresses. ""At this stage of the internal investigation the Company is unable to predict what conclusions, if any, the SEC will reach or whether the Department of Justice will open a separate investigation to investigate this matter or what potential remedies these agencies may seek. If the SEC or Department of Justice determines that violations of the FCPA have occurred, they could seek civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, against us and/or certain of our employees, as well as changes to our business practices and compliance programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, such actions, whether actual or alleged, could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving these matters is expensive and consumes significant time and attention of our senior management. ""Based on information obtained to date in our internal investigation, we have not determined if any potential liability that may result is either probable or can be reasonably estimated. As a result, we have not made any accrual in our financial statements at December 31, 2007. Management and the Audit Committee will work with independent counsel and appropriate personnel within the Company to implement promptly such measures as are considered appropriate. ""We continue to use alternative procedures adopted after the commencement of the investigation to obtain Nigerian temporary import permits. These procedures are designed to assure FCPA compliance. Although we are still working and pursuing additional work in West Africa, we have declined or terminated available projects and delayed the start of certain projects in Nigeria in order to ensure FCPA compliance and appropriate security for our personnel and assets. The possibility exists that we may have to curtail or cease our operations in Nigeria if appropriate long-tern solutions cannot be identified and implemented. We have worldwide customer relationships and a mobile fleet, and we are prepared to redeploy vessels to other areas as necessary to assure the vessels are utilized to the fullest extent possible. ""Notwithstanding that the internal investigation is ongoing, we have concluded that certain changes to our compliance program would provide us with greater assurance that we are in compliance with the FCPA and its record-keeping requirements.

In late March 2004, federal attorneys with Brazil's Public Ministry (the 'Public Ministry Attorneys') recommended that criminal charges be brought against nine individuals, including four senior officers of CEF, Antonio Carlos Rocha, the former Senior Vice President of GTECH and President of GTECH Brazil, and Marcelo Rovai, then GTECH Brazil's marketing director and currently employed in GTECH's Latin America Group ('Denuncia 1'). The Public Ministry Attorneys had recommended that Messrs. Rocha and Rovai be charged with offering an improper inducement in connection with the negotiation of the 2003 Contract Extension, and co-authoring, or aiding and abetting, certain allegedly fraudulent or inappropriate management practices of the CEF management who agreed to enter into the 2003 Contract Extension. Neither GTECH nor GTECH Brazil were the subject of this criminal investigation, and under Brazilian law, entities cannot be subject to criminal charges in connection with this matter.""In June 2004, the judge reviewing the charges in Denuncia 1 prior to their being filed refused to initiate the criminal charges against the nine individuals but instead granted a request by the Brazilian Federal Police to continue the investigation which had been suspended upon the recommendation of the Public Ministry Attorneys that criminal charges be brought. The Brazilian Federal Police subsequently ended their nvestigation and presented a report of their findings to the court. This report did not recommend that indictments be issued against Messrs. Rocha or Rovai, or against any current or former employee of GTECH or GTECH Brazil. The Public Ministry Attorneys then requested that the Brazilian Federal Police reopen their investigation. We understand that the Federal Police subsequently completed their investigation and, in August 2010 issued a report, based entirely upon the June 21, 2006 Brazilian congressional report described below, which has been sent to the Public Ministry Attorneys.""b.  Notwithstanding the favourable resolution of the Brazilian Federal Police's initial investigation, on June 21, 2006, a special investigating panel of the Brazilian congress issued a report and voted, among other things, to ask the Public Ministry Attorneys to indict 84 individuals, including one current and three former employees of GTECH Brazil, alleging that the individuals helped GTECH Brazil to illegally obtain the 2003 Contract Extension. GTECH found nothing in the congressional report to cause it to believe that any present or former employee of GTECH or GTECH Brazil committed any criminal offence in connection with obtaining the 2003 Contract Extension.""c.  GTECH conducted an internal investigation of the 2003 Contract Extension under the supervision of the independent directors of GTECH Holdings Corporation. GTECH found no evidence that GTECH, GTECH Brazil, or any of their current or former employees violated any law, or is otherwise guilty of any wrongdoing in connection with these matters.""The U.S. SEC began an informal inquiry in February 2004, which formal inquiry became a formal investigation in July 2004, into the Brazilian criminal allegations against Messrs. Rocha and Rovai, and GTECH's involvement in the facts surrounding the 2003 Contract Extension, to ascertain whether there has been any violation of United States law in connection with these matters. In addition, in May 2005, representatives of the United States Department of Justice asked to participate in a meeting with GTECH and the SEC. GTECH cooperated fully with the SEC and the United States Department of Justice with regard to these matters, including by responding to their requests for information and documentation. In August 2009, GTECH was advised by the SEC that the SEC had concluded its investigation and did not intend to recommend enforcement action.""d.  These favourable developments notwithstanding, in late 2010, GTECH received copies of the following two related sets of new criminal charges (each, a 'Denuncia') that Public Ministry Attorneys recommend be brought  against individuals (including one current and two former GTECH employees), respecting CEF's contracts with Racimec and GTECH Brazil.""(1)  In September 2010, GTECH received a copy of new criminal charges that Public Ministry Attorneys recommend to a Brazilian Federal judge be filed against 16 individuals, including 14 current or former CEF officers and employees, Antonio Carlos Rocha and Marcos Andrade, a former officer of GTECH Brazil ('Denuncia 2'). The Public Ministry Attorneys assert that the defendants 'swindled public money' through entering into successive illegal price changes, contract extensions and other amendments to CEF's contracts with Racimec and GTECH Brazil, and agreeing to reduce or eliminate contractual fines and penalties that should properly have been imposed upon Racimec and GTECH Brazil. Such allegations echo charges, discussed below, which have been made in the past by the: (i) Public Ministry Attorneys in their April 2004 civil action, and (ii) Federal Court of Accounts in their 2003 TCU Audit Report. These more recent allegations by the Public Ministry Attorneys include the claim made in the April 2004 civil action that a consulting company in which a former CEF director held an interest served as an intermediary in contract negotiations between CEF and a Brazilian public utility pursuant to which CEF allowed the public utility to provide prepaid cellular phone cards through the CEF lottery network operated by GTECH Brazil. GTECH Brazil was not a party to this agreement, entered into in 1999. The Public Ministry Attorneys advance the theory that the consulting company received the 1999 contract in consideration for the former CEF director's assistance in influencing CEF negotiations to the advantage of GTECH Brazil. The Public Ministry Attorneys advance no new facts that would support this new allegation.""(2)  In November 2010, GTECH received a copy of criminal charges that Public Ministry Attorneys recommend to a Brazilian Federal judge be filed against nine individuals, including Antonio Carlos Rocha, Marcelo Rovai and Marcos Andrade ('Denuncia 3'). The Public Ministry Attorneys assert that the defendants be charged with corruption for using improper influence and offering undue advantage as a form of payment to obtain the 2003 Contract Extension. The Public Ministry Attorneys advance no new facts that would support this new allegation. GTECH finds nothing in these charges that would lead it to believe that any present or former employee of GTECH or GTECH Brazil committed any criminal offense involving any contract between Racimec or GTECH Brazil and CEF.  Neither GTECH nor GTECH Brazil is named as a defendant in these criminal charges and, as noted above, under Brazilian law entities cannot be subject to criminal charges in connection with these matters.""Each of these charges must be approved by a Brazilian Federal judge prior to their being filed. As part of this process, the judge has allowed each of the defendants in Denuncia 2, including Messrs. Rocha and Andrade, an opportunity to present a defense prior to his decision to accept or reject Denuncia 2. We have not been advised as to whether the judge in Denuncia 3 will likewise allow the defendants to present a defense prior to deciding whether to accept or reject each of the charges in Denuncia 3. Messrs. Rocha, Rovaand Andrade have not yet been served with any Denuncia setting forth charges against them. GTECH believes that its two former employees and one current employee involved have strong substantive and procedural defenses and that the assertions made against them are groundless.""",AIQB7XXL5K2FR,Yes,2015-04-07 23:38:49 UTC32LAQ1JNT9PMW1U84407C529JHZUT3,202,JOHNSON & JOHNSON,"J&J; described the (at the time ongoing) investigation as follows in its SEC Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2010:""In February 2006, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting documents relating to the participation by several Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries in the United Nations Iraq Oil for Food Program.

Around that time, the company made a voluntary disclosure to the DOJ and SEC.Maxwell described the ongoing investigation as follows in 2009 SEC Form 10-K:""As a result of our international operations, we are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. As a result of an internal review, we are currently conducting an inquiry into the nature of certain payments made to our former independent sales agent in China with respect to sales of our high voltage capacitor products produced by our Swiss subsidiary. These payments equaled them difference between our quoted price for certain products and the amount that the independent sales agent was able to sell such products to certain customers in China. These payments had previously been recorded as commissions; however, a portion of those payments may actually have been rebated directly or indirectly to customers. We recorded commissions to the agent of $585,000, $1.8 million and $653,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These commissions were based on sales of $3.1 million, $8.2 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts are recorded as a reduction to revenue for the periods presented. In 2008, these amounts were recorded as commission expense and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. This independent sales agent also worked as an independent sales agent for Metar (see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report). We terminated our relationship with this independent sales agent as of May 20, 2009. ""We are in the process of evaluating how these payments should be treated for FCPA purposes, which could harm our business. Our internal review is focused on a thorough examination of all of our international operations and business practices, as well as a review of our compliance programs. We have taken certain remedial actions, including terminating our relationship with the independent sales agent in China as well as terminating our relationship with Metar, which could harm our business.

The amount we recorded was based on our estimation of loss as required under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ('GAAP') and discussions with both government agencies. These discussions have resulted in our estimate of a potential settlement range of $9.3 million to $20.0 million. The top end of the range of $20.0 million represents the combined first offer of settlement recently put forth by the relevant governmental agencies. Discussions with the SEC and DOJ are ongoing in an effort to resolve these matters, but whether agreement can be reached and on what terms, is uncertain. The amount of any disgorgements, penalties and/or fines that we could face depends on a number of eventual factors which are not currently known to us or have not yet been resolved with the relevant government authorities, including findings by relevant authorities regarding the amount, nature and scope of any improper payments, the amount of any pecuniary gain involved, our ability to pay, and the level of cooperation provided to government authorities during the investigations. There can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached at all, or that any final settlement amount will not be more or less than our accrual of $9.3 million. Actual payments to the government agencies in connection with any settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.""Maxwell provided the following update regarding its settlement negotiations with the SEC and DOJ in a SEC Form 8-K released on 29 July 2010:""As previously disclosed in its public filings, the company has engaged in settlement discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) with regard to the ongoing FCPA investigations involving Maxwell's Swiss subsidiary, Maxwell S.A.

The company anticipates that it will have to pay interest on any deferred amounts due in both the SEC and DOJ settlement agreements. In Q409, the company accrued $9.3 millionfor a potential settlement, and has accrued an additional $3.4 million in Q210 to reflect the full amount of its pending settlement offers to the SEC and DOJ.

Parker Drilling then initiated an internal investigation, through which it discovered that ""an individual who may be considered a foreign official under the FCPA owns in trust a substantial stake in a foreign subcontractor with whom the Company does business through a joint venture relationship in Kazakhstan."" Additional details regarding the FCPA allegations surfaced on 16 April 2013, when it was announced that Parker Drilling reached a settlement with both the DOJ and SEC to resolve FCPA charges stemming from allegations in Nigeria. According to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (""DPA"") between Parker Drilling and the DOJ, Parker Drilling's customs agent (Panalpina Nigeria) submitted false paperwork on Parker Drilling's behalf from 2001 to 2004 in order to receive temporary import permits (""TIPs"") and thereby avoid import duties on the Company's five oil rigs in Nigeria. A government panel called the Temporary Import Panel, which had been created to determine whether Nigeria was losing customs duty revenue from illegal TIPs, began investigating Parker Drilling in 2002. The Panel found that Parker Drilling had unlawfully received TIPs and TIP extensions through the falsified paperwork submitted by Panalpina Nigeria, and imposed a USD 3.8 million fine on the Company. According to the DPA, Parker Drilling sought to reduce this fine through a Nigerian customs agent. Throughout 2004, the Company allegedly made multiple payments totaling USD 1.25 million to the agent, and he spent some portion of this money on entertainment for Nigerian government officials potentially including officials from the Temporary Import Panel, the Ministry of Finance, the Nigerian president's office and the State Security Service. The customs agent negotiated a reduction in Parker Drilling's fine from USD 3.8 million to USD 750,000. Parker Drilling's payments to the agent were allegedly approved by senior executives. According to the SEC's complaint of 16 April 2013, the payments were not properly recorded in the Company's books and records.Although the Company mentioned in its 2011 Form 10-K that the SEC and DOJ were investigating possible FCPA violations in Kazakhstan and other countries in addition to Nigeria, neither the DOJ's DPA nor the SEC's complaint mentions any allegations outside of Nigeria.Parker Drilling also faces several shareholder derivative suits based on the alleged misconduct.

The investigation in certain of these additional areas of operations focused on customs, immigration and marketing practices, as well as measures taken by the company or related parties in certain of these jurisdictions to obtain local tax relief or abatement.

Pending any additional investigation that may be requested by the United States Department of Justice or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, special counsel has substantially completed its investigation and its more limited review and reported its findings to the Audit Committee in late May 2008. During the course of its investigation, special counsel identified and periodically reported to the Audit Committee certain weaknesses in the company‰Ûªs FCPA compliance program, as well as certain practices that needed correction, and the company has diligently responded to counsel‰Ûªs observations and recommendations to upgrade its overall compliance posture. In addition, the company has independently pursued, under the guidance of its senior management and the Board of Directors, the development and implementation of a more robust FCPA compliance and training program for its employees and agents.

Based on the findings of the investigation reported to the company and the Audit Committee to date, the company has not concluded that any potential liability that may result from an investigation or enforcement action by the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchange Commission is both probable and reasonably estimable, and, thus, no accrual has been recorded as of March 31, 2008. Should additional information be obtained, the company will record a provision when the amount is probable and reasonably estimable. While uncertain, ultimate resolution with one or both of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on the company‰Ûªs results of operations or cash flows.‰Ûù",AS9E0S6DBSWH7,Yes,2015-04-07 23:40:49 UTC3DGDV62G7O9FKXSZ43HH1C6KBNVP2B,230,TRANSOCEAN / GLOBAL SANTA FE,"Transocean described the (at the time, ongoing) investigation as follows in its 2009 SEC Form 10-K:‰ÛÏFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could result in fines, criminal penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business. As an international company, we are subject to many laws and regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‰ÛÏFCPA‰Ûù). We are currently involved in several investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC involving our operations and whether or not we or any of our employees have violated the FCPA. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any current or future investigations, the total costs to be incurred in completing such investigations, the potential impact on personnel, the effect of implementing any further measures that may be necessary to ensure full compliance with applicable laws or to what extent, if at all, we could be subject to fines, sanctions or other penalties which could be material under certain circumstances. Our current investigations include a review of amounts paid to and by customs brokers in connection with the obtaining of permits for the temporary importation of vessels and the clearance of goods and materials. These permits and clearances are necessary in order for us to operate our vessels in certain jurisdictions. There is a risk that we may not be able to obtain import permits or renew temporary importation permits in West African countries, including Nigeria, in a manner that complies with the FCPA. As a result, we may not have the means to renew temporary importation permits for rigs located in the relevant jurisdictions as they expire or to send goods and equipment into those jurisdictions, in which event we may be forced to terminate the pending drilling contracts and relocate the rigs or leave the rigs in these countries and risk permanent importation issues, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, termination of drilling contracts could result in damage claims by customers. Following the completion of existing investigations, we will continue to be subject to the FCPA and these risks. See ‰ÛÏItem 7. Management‰Ûªs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‰ÛÓOutlook‰ÛÒRegulatory Matters.‰Ûù......Regulatory matters‰ÛÓIn June 2007, GlobalSantaFe‰Ûªs management retained outside counsel to conduct an internal investigation of its Nigerian and West African operations, focusing on brokers who handled customs matters with respect to its affiliates operating in those jurisdictions and whether those brokers have fully complied with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‰ÛÏFCPA‰Ûù) and local laws. GlobalSantaFe commenced its investigation following announcements by other oilfield service companies that they were independently investigating the FCPA implications of certain actions taken by third parties in respect of customs matters in connection with their operations in Nigeria, as well as another company‰Ûªs announced settlement implicating a third party handling customs matters in Nigeria. In each case, the customs broker was reported to be Panalpina Inc., which GlobalSantaFe used to obtain temporary import permits for its rigs operating offshore Nigeria. GlobalSantaFe voluntarily disclosed its internal investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice (the ‰ÛÏDOJ‰Ûù) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (‰ÛÏSEC‰Ûù) and, at their request, expanded its investigation to include the activities of its customs brokers in certain other African countries. The investigation is focusing on whether the brokers have fully complied with the requirements of their contracts, local laws and the FCPA and GlobalSantaFe‰Ûªs possible involvement in any inappropriate or illegal conduct in connection with such brokers. In late November 2007, GlobalSantaFe received a subpoena from the SEC for documents related to its investigation. In addition, the SEC advised GlobalSantaFe that it had issued a formal order of investigation. After the completion of the merger with GlobalSantaFe, outside counsel began formally reporting directly to the audit committee of our board of directors. Our legal representatives are keeping the DOJ and SEC apprised of the scope and details of their investigation and producing relevant information in response to their requests. On July 25, 2007, our legal representatives met with the DOJ in response to a notice we received requesting such a meeting regarding our engagement of Panalpina Inc. for freight forwarding and other services in the U.S. and abroad. The DOJ informed us that it was conducting an investigation of alleged FCPA violations by oil service companies who used Panalpina Inc. and other brokers in Nigeria and other parts of the world. We developed an investigative plan which has continued to be amended and which would allow us to review and produce relevant and responsive information requested by the DOJ and SEC. The investigation was expanded to include one of our agents for Nigeria. This investigation and the legacy GlobalSantaFe investigation are being conducted by outside counsel who reports directly to the audit committee of our board of directors. The investigation has focused on whether the agent and the customs brokers have fully complied with the terms of their respective agreements, the FCPA and local laws and the company‰Ûªs and its employees‰Ûª possible involvement in any inappropriate or illegal conduct in connection with such brokers and agent. Our outside counsel has coordinated their efforts with the DOJ and the SEC with respect to the implementation of our investigative plan, including keeping the DOJ and SEC apprised of the scope and details of the investigation and producing relevant information in response to their requests. The SEC has also now issued a formal order of investigation in this case and issued a subpoena for further information, including information related to the U.S. Treasury Department‰Ûªs Office of Foreign Assets Control (‰ÛÏOFAC‰Ûù) investigation described below. Our internal compliance program has detected a potential violation of U.S. sanctions regulations in connection with the shipment of goods to our operations in Turkmenistan. Goods bound for our rig in Turkmenistan were shipped through Iran by a freight forwarder. Iran is subject to a number of economic regulations, including sanctions administered by OFAC, and comprehensive restrictions on the export and re-export of U.S.-origin items to Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to sanctions and export restrictions may subject us to criminal sanctions and civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or seizures of our assets. See ‰ÛÏItem 1A. Risk Factors‰ÛÒOur non-U.S. operations involve additional risks not associated with our U.S. operations.‰Ûù We have self-reported the potential violation to OFAC and retained outside counsel who conducted an investigation of the matter and submitted a report to OFAC. We are continuing to cooperate with the DOJ, SEC and OFAC. We expect these investigations will continue to result in the incurrence of significant legal fees and related expenses as well as involve significant management time. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these investigations, the total costs to be incurred in completing the investigations, the potential impact on personnel, the effect of implementing any further measures that may be necessary to ensure full compliance with applicable laws or to what extent, if at all, we could be subject to fines, sanctions or other penalties. In response to these investigations, we have implemented measures to strengthen and expand our compliance program and training.In addition, from time to time, we receive inquiries from governmental regulatory agencies regarding our operations around the world, including inquiries with respect to types of matters similar to those described above. To the extent appropriate under the circumstances, we investigate such matters, respond to such inquiries and cooperate with the regulatory agencies. Although we are unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, we do not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these inquiries to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.‰ÛùTo this statement the company added, in its SEC Form 10-K filed on 27 February 2012, that it had also received an SEC subpoena regarding posssible OFAC violations in Myanmar.",A2HESXT4DAGASU,No,2015-04-07 23:42:20 UTC3JTPR5MTZSC683E69UE732NX1NG5KR,231,TYCO INTERNATIONAL / TYCO ELECTRONICS / COVIDIEN,"Following the entry of a civil judgment in an FCPA action in 2006, the Company undertook an FCPA review of all of its operating entities, including 454 companies in 50 countries.

On July 29, 2008, the Company filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 and now believes it is in compliance with all SEC filing requirements. Additionally, on August 6, 2008, the Company received notification from NASDAQ informing the Company that the NASDAQ hearing panel had determined to continue listing the Company‰Ûªs common stock on the NASDAQ.During the course of the SEC inquiry, the Company became aware of allegations of misconduct relating to the Company‰Ûªs business practices in the Asia Pacific region that, if true, may constitute violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. These potential FCPA violations include alleged misconduct related to a Chinese customer and an Indonesian customer. In addition, the Special Committee was informed and made the Company aware of allegations of possible fraud perpetrated against the Company and violations of the Company‰Ûªs Code of Conduct and Ethics, or Policy. The allegations of possible fraud and violations of the Policy involve payments from a reseller to certain non-management employees (whose employment has since been terminated) and other potentially inappropriate commercial relationships between non-management employees and a reseller. On January 27, 2009, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to the Company‰Ûªs business practices in Vietnam. In connection with such SEC investigation, the Company produced documents and provided testimony relevant to the SEC‰Ûªs investigation and is continuing to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation. In January 2010, the Company reached a tentative resolution with the staff of the SEC regarding the matters described above. Under the terms of the resolution, the Company will consent, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of an injunction prohibiting violations of the non-fraud provisions of the FCPA and to pay a civil penalty of $300,000. The agreement requires approval by the SEC and is subject to court approval.

The Company voluntarily disclosed this matter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Company had engaged in negotiations with the staff of the SEC and DOJ to resolve potential violations of the FCPA relating to these payments. Those negotiations reached a stage at which the Company was able to estimate a probable pre-tax charge in connection with these matters of approximately $5.3 million, which amount includes estimated disgorgement of profits and interest. This has been reflected in its results for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company had recorded this charge, net of tax, in discontinued operations as these potential violations pertained to CWV, which had been classified as discontinued operations in 2009. The Company sold CWV in January 2010. There is currently no definitive agreement with the SEC staff or DOJ for the resolution of this matter, including with respect to any disgorgement of profits, fines, penalties or interest payment, and any agreement will be subject to the approval by the Commissioners of the SEC and senior DOJ personnel. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company's negotiations with the SEC staff and DOJ will result in a definitive agreement, and the amount of the loss upon final disposition of these matters may exceed the Company's current estimate . . .

The amount of any fines or monetary penalties which could be assessed would depend on, among other factors, findings regarding the amount, timing, nature and scope of any improper payments, whether any such payments were authorized by or made with knowledge of Watts or its affiliates, the amount of gross pecuniary gain or loss involved, and the level of cooperation provided to the government authorities during the investigation.

According to the allegations, the Company made payments totaling SEK 12 million (approximately USD 1.9 million in November 2007) to the account of the Omani official in close proximity to Ericsson's winning bid for mobile network expansion in Oman (worth SEK 300 million). However, the story quoted a Swedish prosecutor as saying that authorities there will not open an investigation of these allegations due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.  Bulgaria, Libya, Poland and SloveniaAccording to press reports from 26 May 2003, the Swiss Federal Public Prosecutor's Office began investigating Ericsson in 2003 for alleged bribery of officials in Bulgaria, Libya, Poland and Slovenia in connection with mobile contracts.  The investigation was apparently prompted by reports from Swiss bank UBS after finding CHF 550 million in irregularities in the Company's financial transactions. According to a report from Reuters on 10 September 2003, the Swiss investigators did not find enough evidence to charge Ericsson with bribery.RussiaThe Local, a Swedish English-language newspaper, reported on 25 November 2004 that Swiss authorities began investigating allegations of a ""payment of one billion crowns from Switzerland via Austria to Russia in connection with a railway building project that was never implemented."" The current status of this investigation is unclear.Costa RicaTransparency International's OECD Anti-Bribery Convention Progress Report 2009 says that Ericsson has been under investigation in Costa Rica for ""alleged bribery of officials at the National Institute of Electricity,"" which is the state-owned Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (""ICE""). According to Inside Costa Rica's report of 6 October 2004, ICE initiated an investigation into allegations that Ericsson had paid for two ICE officials to travel to Prague. ICE's investigation purportedly determined that the allegations were true, and decided to re-open the bid for 600,000 new cellular phone lines that Ericsson had originally won. Inside Costa Rica reported on 3 June 2005 that Ericsson would proceed with the contract, presumably after having won the bid that was re-opened after ICE's investigation of Ericsson.RomaniaAccording to a Business New Europe report on 7 November 2012, allegations of bribery in Romania surfaced due to an arbitration case between Ericsson and its former Romania country manager, Thomas Lundin.  In the arbitration case, Ericsson accused Lundin of embezzling money from the Company, while Lundin has insisted that the Company's board in Romania knew that the money was in fact given as bribes to Romanian politicians. According to the story, Lundin alleges that USD 7 million was paid to Romanian officials in exchange for the award of a EUR 40 million contract for the ""112"" national emergency assistance service to Ericsson in 2003.  The Business New Europe article says that Cristian Sima, the owner of a British Virgin Islands investment company called WBS Holding, made public statements in Icelandic media to the effect that Lundin served as a managing partner in WBS Holding and told him that bribes were paid through the accounts of a Romanian journalist at WBS Holding. The Wall Street Journal reported on 23 May 2013 that the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (""SEC"") has initiated an investigation into the allegations of bribery in Romania. ChinaIn an 11 October 2011 story, the China Times reported that Shen Changfu, former chairman and president of China Mobile Chongqing Branch, was on trial for accusations of bribery. The allegations were that he accepted CNY 36.2 million from Ericsson as well as the Chinese telecommunications supplier Huawei in 1996 when he arranged for Ericsson's facilities to be purchased by the Chongqing Telecom Bureau, which Shen then directed.  The CNY 36.2 million bribe represented 2% of the purchase deal, according to the prosecution. Shen was also accused of procuring advantages for members of his family (from Huawei), including a few years of salary for his son, who was employed briefly by Huawei.GreeceAccording to Reuters, Ericsson allegedly paid 116 million Swedish crowns (approximately USD $18 million) to a commercial agent, which was then used to bribe Greek officials to secure a deal for Ericsson in 1999.  Ericsson said in a statement that it had paid money to the commercial agent, but did not know what became of it.

Thirty-one homes and offices in Germany and the Czech Republic were raided in total, prosecutors said.

In connection with the formal, non public SEC investigation, the SEC issued a subpoena to us requesting documents regarding a range of matters including but not limited to documents relating to potential payments or transfer of anything of value to regulators and government-owned entities in China; documents relating to bids or contracts with state or government-owned entities in China; documents relating to intermediary or local agent of the Company in China; documents regarding the Company‰Ûªs ethics and anti-corruption policies, training, and audits; and documents relating to certain Company financial and other disclosures made by the Company. The DOJ is currently conducting an investigation of us in connection with compliance with the FCPA, as to which they have advised us that the DOJ has information about the Company‰Ûªs practices suggesting possible violations. We have been cooperating with, and will continue to cooperate with, the investigations by and inquiries from the SEC and DOJ. In response to these matters, our board of directors has appointed a special committee of independent directors to oversee our response to the government inquiry. Based on an initial review, the special committee is conducting an independent investigation as to matters reflected in and arising from the SEC and DOJ investigations including, but not limited to, certain sales and marketing matters in China, in order to evaluate whether any violation of the FCPA or other laws occurred. We are unable to predict what consequences, if any, that any investigation by any regulatory agency or by our special committee may have on us. These and any other regulatory investigations and our cooperation with them will result in substantial legal and accounting expenses, and could divert management‰Ûªs attention from other business concerns and harm our business. If we fail to comply with regulations or to carry out controls on our Chinese or other foreign operations in a manner that satisfies all applicable laws, our business would be harmed. Any civil or criminal action commenced against us by a regulatory agency could result in administrative orders against us, the imposition of significant penalties and/or fines against us, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions against certain of our officers, directors and/or employees. The investigations, results of the investigations, or remedial actions we may take, if any, as a result of such investigations, may adversely affect our business in China. If we are subject to an adverse finding resulting from the SEC and DOJ investigations, or from our own independent investigation, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us. In addition, we could incur additional expenses related to fines, or to remediative measures including if we determine that our compliance programs, internal controls or disclosure controls are not effective. The period of time necessary to resolve our independent investigation, and the investigation by the DOJ and the SEC is uncertain, and these matters could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business.We are taking actions to improve our practices and policies regarding compliance with law, and have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our implementation of our policy on compliance with laws.We have consistently maintained a policy that our employees comply with all applicable laws. However, in the course of evaluating our existing training, policies and internal controls over financial reporting and expense approval and expense reimbursement practices, and of the matters brought to the attention of management by the special committee, we determined that our guidelines, employee training and expense approval practices and our internal controls with respect to certain matters, including the payment for, or reimbursement of, third party gifts, travel expenses, honoraria and sponsorship of certain third party events required improvements in order to provide reasonable assurance that our policy on compliance with applicable laws was effective. In addition, management determined that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 relating to our implementation of our policy on compliance with laws.During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we initiated or commenced various remediation efforts to provide reasonable assurance of our implementation of our policy on compliance with laws, including the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws as described in ""Management‰Ûªs Annual Report on, and Changes in, Internal Control over Financial Reporting"". As a result of adopting new practices, guidelines and other measures, certain of our sales and marketing practices will change. In particular these actions will impose restrictions and limitations on certain expenses including payments for, or reimbursement of, third-party gifts, travel expenses, honoraria and sponsorships of medical, scientific or other third party events. Our efforts to implement these changes will require substantial effort and expense, and changes in types or amount of expenses we‰Ûªll pay or reimburse could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.""The company is also the subject of a variety of shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits based on the alleged misconduct.

According to the superseding indictment, Lindsey and Lee then caused the money requested in the fraudulent invoices to be wired into Grupo's brokerage account, allegedly knowing that the invoices were fraudulent and the funds were being used as bribes.""Enrique and Angela Aguilar allegedly then laundered the money in the Grupo brokerage account to make concealed payments for the benefit of CFE officials.

In August, 2004, Teleglobe initiated investigations into potential instances of non-compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") by ITXC Corp. (""ITXC""), which it had acquired. Those instances related to ITXC's operations in certain African countries prior to its acquisition by Teleglobe. Teleglobe also voluntarily notified the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") of the matter, and the Company has been cooperating fully with the SEC and the DOJ. In February 2005, ITXC was also made the subject of a formal order of investigation by the SEC in connection with possible violations of the FCPA and related violations of US securities laws. Resulting from complaints filed by the SEC and DOJ in the federal court in New Jersey, ITXC's former regional director for Africa was charged with and sentenced for both civil and criminal violations of the FCPA. On September 7, 2006, the SEC filed a civil action in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against two former ITXC employees, charging them with FCPA bribery and books and records violations. Both these former employees pleaded guilty to the charges and were sentenced in July and September 2008. The Company intends to continue to cooperate fully with the SEC and DOJ in the investigation. The Company cannot predict the extent to which the SEC, the DOJ or any other governmental authorities will pursue administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines or penalties or other remedies or sanctions. The Company has not identified, and does not believe it is likely that, any material adjustment to its consolidated financial statements is or will be required in connection with the results of this investigation, although it is possible that a monetary penalty, if any, may be material to its results of operations in the period in which it is imposed.On February 9, 2007, the plaintiff, 21st Century Technologies Ltd. filed a suit against Teleglobe America Inc. before the Federal High Court of Nigeria, Lagos Division, alleging that Teleglobe improperly terminated a GlobeInternet Services Agreement pursuant to which Teleglobe rendered Internet access and satellite connectivity services to 21st Century. The suit alleges that Teleglobe's termination of the agreement was improper, resulting in damages arising from 21st Century's lease of capacity from INTELSAT. The plaintiff is seeking $2,067,000 as damages. The Company entered a conditional appearance and filed a motion challenging the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the matter in view of the jurisdiction provisions in the applicable Internet Services Agreement. It is our assertion that Virginia, USA constitutes the proper venue for resolution of any disputes based upon the terms of the contract. All hearings for this matter have so far been adjourned and not proceeded. (Note that in November 2003, Teleglobe filed suit against the plaintiff in Virginia, USA alleging that the plaintiff improperly terminated the abovementioned GlobeInternet Services Agreement, whereby the Company rendered Internet access and satellite connectivity services to the plaintiff. On February 27, 2004, the Court entered a default judgment against 21st Century, and later set damages at $1,231,492.05. The Company is seeking to enforce the judgment in Nigeria. 21st Century initiated an action before the Federal High Court of Lagos State, Nigeria, seeking a declaratory judgment barring enforcement of any judgment obtained by the Company based upon improper service of process. The High Court ruled in favour of 21st Century. The Company appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal and the appeal was heard on April 10, 2008. On July 4, 2008, judgment in the appeal was delivered in favour of the Company (the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court where it refused to register the judgment obtained by Teleglobe in Virginia, USA). However, 21st Century have filed a Notice of Appeal and Motion for stay of execution of the Court of Appeal's judgment.

Any violation of the FCPA or other anti‰öÕcorruption laws could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Other requirements can also be imposed on companies that violate the FCPA, including the appointment of a government‰öÕapproved monitor or the implementation of enhanced compliance procedures. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business and, if material, could be deemed a breach or event of default under our credit facilities. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.In late 2008, in the course of routine monitoring of our internal controls, our internal audit staff discovered certain payments made and expenses for entertainment provided to government officials in India from approximately 2006 to 2008 that may have been in violation of the FCPA as well as Indian law. The payments and entertainment expenses were related to our quality assurance business and totaled approximately $26,000. Upon discovering such payments and expenses and performing an initial review and evaluation with the assistance of an outside forensic accounting firm, our Audit Committee directed outside legal counsel to perform an investigation. Our internal audit staff, outside legal counsel or forensic accounting firm performed investigative procedures in 12 of our foreign locations where major international operations are conducted. In the course of that investigation, we discovered up to approximately $74,000 in additional expenses since 2003 in two other jurisdictions that also may be inconsistent with the requirements of the FCPA. Our internal investigation uncovered no evidence that the payments or expenses were related to (i) falsifying, altering or otherwise influencing the conduct of our quality assurance tests or test results or (ii) securing any government contracts.After completing our internal investigation, we made personnel changes in India and enhanced our FCPA‰öÕrelated policies and procedures, including providing additional ethical and FCPA training to key employees, enhancing our monitoring of expenses and other internal controls and appointing a chief compliance director. It is possible that despite our efforts, additional FCPA issues, or issues under anti‰öÕcorruption laws of other jurisdictions, could arise in the future.

As of March 18, 2010, the DOJ has not informed us as to whether it intends to pursue this matter further. In addition, in connection with our initial public offering, the SEC advised us that because it does not appear that we were subject to the SEC's jurisdiction during the relevant period, the SEC does not intend to pursue this matter at this time. We cannot predict the outcome resulting from our report to the DOJ. Any criminal prosecution would be costly and time‰öÕconsuming to defend and such defense may not be successful and would have a material adverse effect on our business, result in harm to our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, any fines or penalties imposed by the DOJ could be substantial and any requirements imposed upon us by the DOJ could be difficult, time‰öÕconsuming and expensive to implement and comply with and could result in difficulties in conducting business in foreign jurisdictions and maintaining existing and attracting new customer relationships. Any failure to comply with any such requirements could result in further prosecution, fines or penalties. Any adverse determination by the DOJ, if material, could also be deemed to be a breach of covenants and an event of default under our credit facilities, which could result in our being required to immediately repay the principal amount outstanding under such facilities and prevent us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility, and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.""STR Holdings provided the following update in its SEC Form 10-K filed on March 11, 2011:""In late 2008, in the course of routine monitoring of our internal control, we discovered payments made and expenses incurred in our international Quality Assurance operations in India and China that may have been in violation of the FCPA as well as local law, which resulted in personnel changes and our adoption of enhanced FCPA-related policies, procedures, training and controls.
