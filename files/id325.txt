        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        On January 12, 2011, it was reported that Rony Fuchs, an Israeli businessman, and his associate, Zeev Frenkiel, were being held by Georgian authorities on charges of allegedly offering a USD 7 million bribe to the Georgian Deputy Finance Minister in exchange for his convincing of the Georgian government not to challenge an international arbitration decision under which Mr. Fuchs was awarded USD 98.1 million - to be paid by Georgia - in connection with a failed investment in Georgia's energy infrastructure in the 1990s.  <br /><br />Mr. Fuchs denied the allegations.  His attorney reportedly stated that, in fact, senior Georgian officials were attempting to convince him to kickback a portion of his award to them following disbursement of the award.
