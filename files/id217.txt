        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        In its SEC Form 10-K filed on 28 February 2011, Pfizer stated that the Company had  voluntarily provided the DOJ and the SEC with information concerning potentially improper payments made outside the U.S., and that the Company was "exploring with the DOJ and SEC various ways to resolve the matter."  The Company noted also that it was under investigation in Germany regarding tax violations by a Pfizer subsidiary.  <br /><br />The investigations and settlement negotiations were confirmed in subsequent SEC filings. <br /><br />In a complaint filed by the SEC on 7 August 2012, FCPA books and records violations are alleged in Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Serbia.   According to the complaint, "improper payments were variously made to influence regulatory and formulary approvals, purchase decisions, prescription decisions, and to clear customs. ...These improper payments were made without the knowledge or approval of officers or employees of Pfizer, but the inaccurate books and records of Pfizer’s subsidiaries were consolidated in the financial reports of Pfizer, and Pfizer failed to devise and maintain an appropriate system of internal accounting controls. . . .<br /><br />"[E]mployees of Pfizer’s subsidiaries made and authorized the making of payments of cash and the provision of other things of value both directly and through third parties. Funds for these payments were often generated by the subsidiaries’ employees through the use of collusive vendors, such as travel agents or restaurants, to create fraudulent invoices." <br /><br />Russia Allegations<br />Russian wholesalers contracted directly with Pfizer HCP, and until its acquisition, Pharmacia also maintained an office in Russia.  Between 2000 and 2005, Pfizer Russia,  provided cash payments, gifts, travel and donations to Russian government doctors, in order to obtain regulatory approvals for Pfizer products, to facilitate importation of Pfizer products, and to influence doctors to prescribe them. <br /><br />Payments to health professionals:  From the mid-1990s through 2005, Pfizer Russia employees provided payments of 5% of the value of Pfizer products purchased by the hospital.  The payments rewarded doctors for past purchases or served as incentives for future purchases and prescriptions. In addition to direct payments, Pfizer Russia also made payments through intermediary companies. In some cases the intermediary companies were identified by the recipient doctors, and in other cases they were selected by Pfizer Russia employees.  Pfizer Russia employees obtained the cash to pay the doctors through the use of collusive vendors who provided false invoices to Pfizer.  In order to conceal these transactions, the finance director of Pfizer Russia established two account codes in the company’s General Ledger and instructed employees to record the payments on these accounts.  Between late 2003 and 2005, Pfizer Russia employees booked approximately USD 820,000 to these accounts.<br /><br />Direct payments, called “discounts,” were also made by distributors to hospital administrators for purchasing Pfizer products.  For example, in an email dated November 24, 2005, Pfizer Russia employees discussed the calculation of a “basic discount” of approximately $1,652 in cash, given by the distributor to a government doctor at the hospital. <br /><br />Pfizer Russia employees also made use of travel and entertainment to influence government doctors. For example, in November 2003, a Pfizer Russia employee requested in the cover letter for an invoice “payment for the (motivational) trip of [the First Deputy Minister of Health] for the inclusion of [a Pfizer product] into the list . . . of medications refundable by the state.”  Similarly, in December 2004, a Pfizer Russia employee requested sponsorship for a Moscow Department of Health employee who was assisting the chief pharmacologist of a regional pediatric hospital in compiling algorithms for antibiotic therapy, and who wanted “to be financially compensated” for this work. The Pfizer Russia employee noted that, “in return for this,” the pharmacologist “will include our products in the treatment algorithms.” <br /><br />In another instance, from June 2005, a Pfizer Russia employee noted that a government doctor “should be assigned the task of stretching the amount of the purchases . . . to US $100 thousand” as an “obligation” in exchange for a trip to a conference in the Netherlands or Germany.  Subsequent correspondence indicates that this transaction took place. <br /><br />Payments to Customs Officials:  Bureaucratic requirements for customs clearance of Pfizer products became difficult to fulfill in 2005.  An official from a private certification company licensed by the Russian government proposed that the certification company would overlook the non-compliance of Pfizer Russia’s products in exchange for monthly payments of approximately USD 3,000. Pfizer Russia’s Country Manager approved USD 13,000 such payments through an intermediary company in October, November and December 2005, which was presumed by Pfizer Russia employees to be controlled by the Certification Center’s employees. Customs clearance problems stopped while Pfizer was making these payments, and resumed when Pfizer Russia began a corporate compliance review and ceased making the payments in 2006. <br /><br />Payments to third-party intermediaries:   Pfizer Russia also used third-party intermediaries to make improper payments, with the knowledge and consent of the Country Manager and Finance Director.  For example, in April 2004, a Pfizer Russia employee requested that a payment be made to a public official from Samara “who took an active part in getting [a Pfizer product] into the bidding,” with two invoice cover letters for 100,000 rubles (approximately USD 3,800) to pay an employee of the government of the Samara region healthcare department for purchasing a Pfizer product; another invoice, for the equivalent of USD 4,500, listed the same purpose but was made payable to an intermediary company. <br /><br />In October 2005, Pfizer Russia employees discussed how a regional distributor would provide Pfizer Russia with companies that have “neutral names,” to which Pfizer Russia could make improper payments that would be booked as conferences to provide benefits to doctors. <br /><br />Payments to offshore accounts:  Pfizer Russia also paid sales discounts into offshore bank accounts of shell companies in Latvia and Cyprus, following the practice established by Pharmacia Russia in 1999, and later expanding this to companies in Canada and Hungary.  Pfizer Russia’s Country Manager hid the nature of these payments, telling Pfizer’s regional manager from Germany that the shell companies actually were providing lobbying services necessary to “gain access” to the Russian public sector tender market. Pfizer HCP’s regional management did not verify that the Country Manager’s explanation was accurate, or question how a third-party intermediary being paid outside Russia could lawfully help Pfizer Russia “gain access” to Russian government tenders. <br /><br />The various improper payments described above were falsely recorded by Pfizer Russia employees as “Travel and Entertainment,” “Convention and Trade Meetings,” “Conferences,” “Distribution Freight,” and “Clinical Grants/Clinical Trials.” <br /><br />Bulgaria Allegations<br />From 1999 to 2005, Pfizer HCP Bulgaria paid for domestic and international travel and provided equipment to government-employed doctors in order to influence the officials to prescribe Pfizer products.  In addition, between 1999 and 2003, Pfizer HCP Bulgaria organized “Incentive Trips” to destinations in Greece for Pfizer HCP Bulgaria sales representatives and Bulgarian healthcare providers.  The trips lasted three days and included training, hospitality and entertainment. Pfizer HCP Bulgaria sales representatives were instructed to reach agreements with doctors on the specific quantities of Pfizer products they were required to purchase in order to be sent on an incentive trip.  Pfizer HCP employees concealed the travel and entertainment expenses as training and education costs.<br /><br />China Allegations<br />From 2003 to 2007, Pfizer China paid for international travel, hospitality and gifts to doctors employed by Chinese government healthcare institutions, for the purpose of influencing the officials to to prescribe Pfizer products and use their influence to give Pfizer China an unfair business advantage.  In order to facilitate the payment of rewards and incentives, Pfizer China employees organized meetings with Chinese government doctors that were marketed as “clubs” or “high-prescribing doctors” programs.  <br /><br />For example, in March 2006, a Pfizer China marketing manager explained to his regional sales manager that Pfizer China would only offer to pay for two doctors to travel to a conference in Australia if they promised to “use no less than 4,200 injections a year” and to prescribe a Pfizer product to “more than 80%” of their patients.  <br /><br />Pfizer China employees also made cash gifts to doctors.  They hid the travel, entertainment, gifts and cash payments by failing to record the transactions accurately in the Company's books.<br /><br />Croatia Allegations<br />From 1997 to 2004, Pfizer HCP and Pharmacia Croatia provided similar travel, gifts and entertainment to doctors in the Croatian public health system.  From February 1997 until May 2003, Pharmacia Croatia made monthly payments of approximately USD 1,200 to a bank account in Austria owned by a doctor who served on Croatian government committees that oversaw the registration and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. A senior Pharmacia Croatia manager stated in a 1997 memorandum that the Croatian doctor was expected to ensure that all of Pharmacia’s products were approved by the committee, noting, "as he is a member of the Registration Committee regarding pharmaceuticals, I do expect that all products which are to be registered, will pass the regular procedure by his assistance. . . . He is a person of great influence in Croatia in the area of pharmaceuticals, and his opinion is respected very much; that’s the reason he is so important to us."<br /><br />Payments were made until shortly after the merger of Pharmacia and Pfizer in 2003 (three payments were made after the merger).<br /><br />Pharmacia also initiated a system of bonus payments or kickbacks, giving a percentage of sales to doctors who were employed in senior positions in Croatian government healthcare institutions.  The payments were made in cash, or used to fund international travel, donations of durable goods, or free products.  One product was still a basis for the bonus program until 2005, although most ceased after 2003.<br /><br />These payments were recorded falsely as “Conventions,” “Gifts,” and “Professional Services – Non Consultant” expenses.<br /><br />Czech Republic Allegations<br />Following a similar pattern of payments and entertainment for public health service doctors, in 2003-2004 Pfizer Czech sponsored "educational weekends" attended by approximately 920 health professionals, some of them in the public health service.  The three-day weekends were held in ski resorts in Austria and Slovakia, and involved little educational content.<br /><br />Pfizer Czech also paid for a group of Czech government-employed doctors and pharmacists to visit a Pfizer manufacturing facility in Perth, Australia in October 2004.  The visitors also did sightseeing in Australia and stopped in Hong Kong. At least one of the doctors participated in meetings of a committee that advised the Czech Ministry of Health on drug reimbursement issues.<br /><br />Employees of Pfizer Czech falsely booked these transactions as “Conventions and Trade Meeting.”<br /><br />Italy Allegations<br />A similar patter was discovered in Italy, where Pfizer Italy employees made direct cash payments (ostensibly honoraria and lecture fees), provided goods (e.g., televisions, monitors, mobile telephones, photocopiers, printers), and improper travel sponsorship (e.g., “weekend in European capital,” “weekend in Gallipoli,” “weekend with companion,” “weekend in Rome”) in return for promises by doctors to recommend or prescribe Pfizer’s products during the period 2000-2003.<br /><br />Also, from 1996 through 2003, Pfizer Italy engaged third parties to run observational studies conducted by doctors employed by Italian government healthcare institutions, purportedly to obtain research and marketing information from Italian doctors. In reality, many of the studies lacked scientific value, and were actually designed to influence Italian government doctors to prescribe Pfizer products. Pfizer Italy sales personnel selected doctors to participate based on the doctors’ agreement to prescribe specific quantities of Pfizer products.  Pfizer sales personnel directed cash payments, gifts and other benefits to the doctors, and monitored the performance of the doctors to ensure that the agreed-upon prescription levels were met.<br /><br />The transactions were falsely recorded as “Marketing Expenses,” “Professional Training,” and “Advertising in Scientific Journals.”<br /><br />Kazakhstan Allegations<br />In the late 1990s, an intermediary company approached Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan and asked to become Pfizer's exclusive distributor in Kazakhstan.  Pfizer Kazakhstan's Regional Manager rejected this requested based on company policy not to allow exclusive representation.  The intermediary (called "Company A" in the complaint) informed Pfizer Kazakhstan that it would thereafter have trouble obtaining the necessary registration for its products in Kazakhstan.  This turned out to be true.<br />The Regional Manager explained the situation to his supervisor and indicated that he believed that Company A was associated with senior Kazakh government officials.<br /><br />Company A subsequently contacted the Regional Manager and again demanded an exclusive distributorship, which was granted in May 2000 in the form of a written contract with an oral guarantee of exclusivity.  Pfizer HCP Kazakhstan and Company A later entered into two other distribution agreements.  After the contract lapsed, and Pfizer's product again required registration in Kazakhstan, the registration was not granted until Pfizer Kazakhstan entered into another contract with Company A in 2003.  As stated in the Complain, although Company A was in this instance not granted an exclusive distributorship, it did maintain a non-exclusive distributor relationship through mid-2005 in the belief "that some of the profits from Company A would be provided to senior Kazakh government officials for their assistance in obtaining registration."<br /><br />Serbia Allegations<br />Pfizer HCP Serbia, through one of its sales representatives, paid for a government employed doctor to attend a conference in Chile in exchange for the doctor’s agreement to increase his department’s purchases of Pfizer products. Pfizer HCP Serbia management discovered the improper agreement and terminated the sales representative, but still paid for the trip after the doctor threatened to tarnish Pfizer’s reputation.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The company disclosed the results of an internal compliance review in October 2004.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 8 March 2012, the Croatian justice ministry's corruption investigative body, USKOK, reported that U.S. officials had requested information about Pfizer's possible payment of bribes to doctors in Croatia. <br /><br />On 7 August 2012, the SEC filed a complaint against Pfizer (please see the Compendium summary for Pfizer-Wyeth to an analysis of the SEC's separate complaint against Wyeth).  Without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the complaint, Pfizer consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay disgorgement of USD 16,032,676 in net profits and prejudgment interest of USD 10,307,268 for a total of USD 26,339,944.  In addition, Pfizer is required to submit periodic compliance reports to the SEC at least every nine months for two years. <br /><br />On the same day, the DOJ entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with Pfizer HCP, filing a two-count criminal information charging Pfizer H.C.P. with conspiracy and violations of the FCPA in Bulgaria, Croatia, Kazakhstan and Russia.  The agreement requires Pfizer to pay a USD 15 million penalty.  The DPA is for a period of two years and seven days but may be extended for one year at the DOJ's discretion.  Of particular note is that the DOJ did not require Pfizer to use a compliance monitor as part of the terms of the settlement.<br /><br />In reaching the settlement, the DOJ said that it lessened Pfizer's penalties because of the company's voluntary disclosure and self-investigation.  The government also praised Pfizer's compliance measures, including Pfizer's anti-corruption policies, internal audit program, annual reviews of commercial practices in other markets, due diligence compliance team for mergers and acquisitions, and training tools for Pfizer employees.  
		<h2>COMPLIANCE MONITOR</h2>
        Reporting required but not by an outside monitor.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Cooperation by the parent company, along with full and early disclosure, may reduce the penalty imposed on the subsidiary.</li><li>Extensive remediation and improvement of a company's compliance systems may enable it to avoid imposition of a compliance monitor.</li></ul>
