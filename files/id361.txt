        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        PTC first disclosed its investigation in its Form 10-Q filed on 10 August 2011 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), announcing that it was conducting an internal investigation into payments by business partners in China may have violated the FCPA.  The company identified the questionable payments and voluntarily disclosed them to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC. Later in 2011, PTC terminated certain employees and business partners in China in connection with its internal investigation.<br /><br />On 4 February 2014, PTC disclosed that the DOJ and SEC were investigating "payments and expenses" by China business partners and employees that raised FCPA compliance concerns.  In its SEC filing, PTC claimed that it had started settlement talks with the DOJ and SEC but the agencies are now requesting more information.  In its Form 10-Q on 6 May 2014, the company confirmed that the investigations by the SEC and DOJ were ongoing, and disclosed that the SEC previously sent a subpoena to PTC.

        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>

PTC noted that it has received no indication from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the status of its investigation of FCPA allegations.<br /><br />In its SEC Form 10-Q filed on 6 May 2014, PTC confirmed that the SEC and DOJ investigations are still ongoing, and both offices continue to request information from the company.
