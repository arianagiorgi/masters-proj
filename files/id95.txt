        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Niels Tobiasen, a Danish national, was the Managing Director of CBRN, a UK specialist consultancy that advises on the threat of chemical and nuclear attacks.  In May 2007, CBRN was awarded a Ugandan government contract, worth GBP 210,000, to supply training and equipment to guard the commonwealth meeting in Kampala which was attended by world leaders including the Queen and Gordon Brown (the UK Prime Minister).  <br /><br />CBRN was in total awarded six contracts worth in excess of GBP 500,000.  Ananias Tumukunbe, a science and technology adviser to the Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, attended at CBRN's offices and demanded payments for what he called "local taxes."  Over eight months Tobiasen sent Tumukunbe five payments worth GBP 83,000.  The payments went to Tumukunbe and a Ugandan military officer, Rusoke Togaswire.

        It is unknown.  It is possible that it was the result of a Suspicious Activity Report ("SAR") made in compliance with the UK anti-money laundering legislation. <br />
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        The convictions in this case, in September 2008, were the first convictions achieved by the newly formed specialist squad at the City of London Police.  <br /><br />Niels Tobiasen pleaded guilty and was given a jail sentence of five months suspended for a year. <br /><br />Ananias Tumukunbe who had been a Private Secretary in the Ugandan Government's Science and Technology Department, pleaded guilty and was jailed for a year.  He has since been deported to Uganda.  Tumukunbe appears to still be serving as an adviser to the Ugandan President.   <br /><br />Rusoke Togaswire, the Ugandan military officer, is still wanted by the City of London Police.  
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>In this case a foreign public official, who committed the relevant act while abroad, was prosecuted and convicted of an offense by the UK courts. </li></ul>
