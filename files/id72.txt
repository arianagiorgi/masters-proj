        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Following serious allegations towards the U.N. administration, among others, the Independent Inquiry Committee ("IIC") was established in 2004 in order to carry out an in-depth inquiry. <br /><br />IIC published eight reports that included information that foreign companies, including Dutch companies, had bypassed U.N. sanctions by making illegal payments when entering into contracts with the Iraqi government.<br /><br />After receiving the information from the Independent Inquiry Committee, the Dutch Ministry of Justice began its national investigations.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        Flowserve BV, Solvochem Holland BV, OPW Fluid Transfer Group Europe BV, Prodetra BV, NV Organon, Alfasan International BV and Stet Holland BV all reached out-of-court settlements with the Dutch Ministry of Justice, according to a Ministry press release on 15 July 2008.  Without admitting guilt, the companies were ordered to pay the following transaction-fees: <br /><br />Flowserve BV: EUR 256,534<br /><br />Solvochem Holland BV: EUR 280,592<br /><br />OPW Fluid Transfer Group Europe BV: EUR 81,804<br /><br />Prodetra BV: EUR 99,236.95<br /><br />NV Organon: EUR 381.602<br /><br />Alfasan International BV: EUR 41,983.55<br /><br />Stet Holland BV: EUR 174,170<br /><br />The Chief Executive Officer of Saybolt International Group BV received a four-month home detention sentence by a U.S. court and was ordered to pay a USD 20,000 penalty.  The Chairman of the Board was accused in U.S. court, but could be not extradited because of Dutch law.  He will likely not be prosecuted in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Trafigura beheer BV is currently under investigation in the United States and will likely not be prosecuted in the Netherlands.
