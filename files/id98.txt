        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        In January 2007, Mabey & Johnson commenced civil proceedings in the High Court in London against some former employees and its agent in Jamaica.  A Defence and Counterclaim filed within those proceedings alleged that it was common practice for Mabey & Johnson to pay government officials in order to secure contracts.  The lawyers instructed by Mabey & Johnson in relation to these civil proceedings, upon a separate Mabey and Johnson instruction, undertook an internal investigation.  The results of that internal investigation were provided to the SFO.  Mabey & Johnson cooperated fully with the SFO, including providing the SFO with privileged notes of internal interviews, directors and employees conducted during the internal investigation. <br /><br />After discovery of the corrupt payment there was a wholesale change of the senior management at Mabey & Johnson. 
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 25 September 2009, Mabey & Johnson received the following sentence: (i) for bribes paid for work in Ghana, the company was fined GBP 750,000 and (ii) for bribes paid for work in Jamaica, the company was fined GBP 750,000; for breach of the UN sanctions in Iraq, the company was fined GBP 2 million.<br /><br />Under the Confiscation Order in relation to money received under contracts secured by illegal payments, the company was ordered to pay GBP 1.1 million.<br /><br />Mabey & Johnson was also ordered to pay the following amounts as reparations: (i) GBP 658,000 to Ghana; (ii) GBP 139,000 to Jamaica; and (iii) GBP 618,000 to Iraq. <br /><br />The company was ordered to pay GBP 350,000 in SFO costs.<br /><br />As part of the agreement reached with the SFO, Mabey & Johnson agreed to strengthen its compliance code and work with a compliance monitor.  The company was expected to spend up to GBP 250,000 in first year monitoring costs.<br /><br />The total financial penalties were approximately GBP 6.5 million.<br /><br />On 10 February 2011, two former directors of Mabey & Johnson - Richard Charles Edward Forsyth (former Managing Director) and David Mabey (former Sales Director) - were found guilty by a jury in Southwark Crown Court of making illegal payments to Iraq during 2001 and 2002 in breach of United Nations sanctions. Another defendant, Richard Gledhill who was Sales Manager for contracts in Iraq, pleaded guilty to sanctions offences at an earlier hearing and gave evidence for the Prosecution.<br /><br />On 23 February 2011, Richard Charles Edward Forsyth was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment, disqualified from acting as a company director for five years and was ordered to pay prosecution costs of GBP 75,000.  David Mabey was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, disqualified from acting as a company director for two years and was ordered to pay prosecution costs of GBP 125,000.  Richard Gledhill was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>This was the first successful UK prosecution of a company for corruption, as well as the first prison sentences handed down by any enforcement authority to individuals for engaging in bribery in breach of UN sanctions in Iraq.</li><li>After the disclosure was made by Mabey & Johnson, the SFO produced its voluntary disclosure programme which is described in an SFO publication Approach of the Serious Fraud Office for dealing with overseas corruption.  The guidance contained with the SFO booklet together with the anticipated further enforcement actions by the SFO will provide a combined body of case law and guidance which will give a good indication of the benefits of using the SFO's disclosure programme.</li><li>The SFO used the Proceeds of Crime Act to require disgorgement of GBP 130,000 based on dividends that were derived from bribe-tainted contracts, in a novel prosecution of investors.</li></ul>
