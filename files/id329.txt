        <h1>SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND INVESTIGATION</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Around a dozen SEC-registered financial services firms, reportedly including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs and HSBC Holdings Plc.

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports, in January 2011 the Boston office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") sent letters to around a dozen financial services firms and financial institutions requesting information related their dealings with state-owned investment funds.  <br /><br />The investigation reportedly concerns whether financial firms - banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms - made improper payments through placement agents to secure investments from sovereign wealth funds. <br /><br />According to press reports in June 2011, the SEC is examining financial firms' involvement with the Libyan Investment Authority (Libya's sovereign wealth fund), among other countries. <br /><br />On 9 August 2011, Goldman Sachs confirmed in a securities filing that the company was under investigation, stating: <br /><br />"Sales, Trading and Clearance Practices. Group Inc. and certain of its affiliates are subject to a number of investigations and reviews, certain of which are industry-wide, by various governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations relating to the sales, trading and clearance of corporate and government securities and other financial products, including compliance with the SEC's short sale rule, algorithmic and quantitative trading, futures trading, securities lending practices, trading and clearance of credit derivative instruments, commodities trading, private placement practices, compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the effectiveness of insider trading controls and internal information barriers."
