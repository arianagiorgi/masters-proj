        The DOJ and SEC investigated Shell and two of its subsidiaries for alleged FCPA violations in connection with their use of Panalpina for logistics and freight forwarding services in Nigeria.  On November 4, 2010, a criminal information was filed charging SNEPCO with conspiring to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery and books and records provisions, and with aiding and abetting a violation of the books and records provisions.  The charges relate to SNEPCO payment of approximately USD 2 million to its subcontractors, knowing that some or all of the money would be paid as bribes to Nigerian customs officials by Panalpina in order to import materials and equipment into the country.
