        <h1>SAINT REGIS UNIVERSITY</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Richard John Novak
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Sales of fake diplomas
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Spokane, Washington, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Liberia<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Novak was employed by Dixie Ellen Randock and Steven Karl Randock, Sr.  The Randocks owned several internet businesses, including Saint Regis University, Robertstown University and James Monroe University.  The universities had no faculty, no curriculum, did not require any course work and were not accredited by the U.S. Department of Education.  They sold fraudulent high school diplomas, college degrees, academic transcripts and deans list designations that were then used by purchasers to obtain jobs, promotions, salary raises, and to qualify for H1-B visas.  The Randocks began operating these businesses in 1999, but did not hire Novak until 2002.  From 2002 through 2005, Novak and his co-conspirators sold fake diplomas to over 9,000 people in the United States and around the world, selling approximately $2.3 million worth of phony academic products.  <br /><br />From 2002 until 2005, Novak paid more than $44,000 to government officials in Liberia to obtain accreditation from the Liberian government for Saint Regis University, Robertstown University, and James Monroe University.  The payments included $6,250 to the Consul at the Liberian Embassy in Washington, DC in exchange for accreditation and recognition of Saint Regis University, and an additional $400 per month to the Consul in exchange for Embassy staff responding to inquiries regarding Saint Regiss accreditation status.  When the Consul at the Liberian Embassy in Washington, DC was removed from his position, Novak paid for a trip to Accra, Ghana for himself and the former Consul in order to lobby Liberian officials meeting at the Embassy in Ghana to reinstate the former Consul to his previous post.  While in Ghana, Novak also paid a Liberian official at the Embassy in Accra for responding to inquiries regarding the three universities accreditation status.  In 2004, the Director General of Higher Education in Liberia issued a statement that the three universities were not accredited by the Liberian Commission on Higher Education.  Novak agreed to pay the Director General $400 per month to ensure that there were no additional problems with the accreditation of three universities.   <br /><br />Other members of the conspiracy, including Dixie Ellen Randock; Steven Karl Randock, Sr.; Blake Alan Carlson; Heidi Kae Lorhan; Amy Leann Hensley; Roberta Lynn Markishtum; and Kenneth Wade Pearson were charged with mail and wire fraud charges for selling fabricated university and high school diplomas over the internet.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The U.S. Secret Service conducted an undercover investigation by having agents pose as high school dropouts seeking to obtain diplomas and college degrees.  During a sting operation, the Secret Service filmed a Liberian diplomat taking a bribe from Novak in a hotel room in Washington, DC.<br /><br />
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On March 20, 2006, Novak pleaded guilty to FCPA and mail and wire fraud charges and was sentenced to three years of probation and three hundred hours of community service.  <br /><br />Novaks co-conspirators pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud charges and received the following sentences: (i) Steven Karl Randock, Sr. was sentenced to 36 months in prison, three years of court supervision and forfeiture of $500,000 in cash, real property and a 2001 Jaguar XK8; (ii) Dixie Ellen Randock was sentenced to 36 months in prison and three years of court supervision; (iii) Heidi Kae Lorhan was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison and two years of court supervision; and (iv) Roberta Markishtum was sentenced to four months in prison and one year of court supervision.  Blake Alan Carlson, Kenneth Wade Pearson and Amy Leann Hensley do not appear to have been sentenced yet.<br />
