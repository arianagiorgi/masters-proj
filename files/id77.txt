        <h1>FARO</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Faro Technologies, Inc. ("Faro")<br />Faro Shanghai Co., Ltd. (wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary of Faro) ("Faro-China")<br />Oscar H. Meza (Faro Director of Asia-Pacific Sales)<br />
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Computerized measurement devices and software
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Lake Mary, Florida, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        China<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ and the SEC alleged that Faro violated the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in connection with USD 444,492 in improper payments made by its Chinese subsidiary to employees of numerous Chinese state-owned or state-controlled companies in 2004 and 2005 in order to obtain sales contracts worth a total of approximately USD 4.5 million.  The SEC also charged Faro's former Director of Asia-Pacific Sales, Oscar H. Meza, with violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions, and with aiding and abetting Faro's violations of the same provisions, in connection with Meza's role in orchestrating and authorizing the improper payments.  <br /><br />The bribes were called referral fees within Faro and were largely orchestrated by Meza and Country Sales Manager, with the latter having insisted that business had to be done the Chinese way and that providing officials with meals and travel was not sufficient.  Throughout 2004 and 2005, Meza authorized the Country Sales Manager to make improper payments to employees of state-owned or state-controlled businesses in China in order to obtain sales contracts.  Meza and the Country Sales Manager made the improper payments despite oral direction from certain Faro officers not to make any such payments, which the officers understood from a legal opinion would be in violation of local Chinese law.   <br /><br />In 2005, Meza and the Country Sales Manager decided to route the payments to Chinese officials through a shell company to avoid exposure (according to internal emails).  In January 2005, Faro-China entered into a fictitious services contract with an intermediary, which would make the improper payments to the officials and then submit invoices to Faro-China under the services contract.  <br /><br />Between 2003 and 2006, Faro failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal controls concerning its foreign sales activities.  Between 2004 and 2006, the company improperly recorded the improper payments made to Chinese officials as selling expenses in its books and records.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Faro voluntarily disclosed the violations to the DOJ and SEC.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 3 June 2008, Faro entered into a two-year non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay a USD 1.1 million criminal penalty.  <br /><br />On 5 June 2008, Faro consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay USD 1.85 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.<br /><br />Faro also agreed to retain an independent corporate monitor (or independent consultant, as described by the SEC) for a two-year period to review and evaluate Faro's internal controls, recordkeeping and financial reporting policies and procedures in the context of FCPA compliance.  At the time of settlement, Faro estimated that the total cost associated with its monitoring obligation would be in the range of USD 1 million to USD 2 million.<br /><br />On 28 August 2009, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Oscar H. Meza consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the FCPA and from aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA.  Meza agreed to pay a USD 30,000 civil penalty, as well as USD 26,707 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Self-disclosing FCPA violations to the enforcement authorities may earn a company an improved settlement arrangement, such as a non-prosecution or deferred prosecution agreement in the place of a guilty plea.    </li></ul>
