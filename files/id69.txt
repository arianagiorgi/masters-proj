        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Tanner Management Corporation ("Tanner")<br />Herbert Tannenbaum (President of Tanner)<br />Cybernet USA (fictitious entity created by Tanner)<br />

        Argentina<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ charged Herbert Tannenbaum, President of Tanner Management Corporation, with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA in connection with a scheme to bribe a supposed Argentine official in order to secure sales of garbage incinerators to the government of Argentina.  <br /><br />According to the criminal information, in October of 1997 Tannenbaum offered a bribe to an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a procurement officer of the Government of Argentina.  Tannenbaum helped incorporate a fictitious entity, Cybernet USA, and establish a bank account in the entity's name, in order to disguise the improper payment.  It appears that Tannenbaum made a payment of $16,000 to the undercover FBI agent, after which he was presumably arrested.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The FBI, the DOJ and the Government of Argentina cooperated in this investigation.  An undercover FBI agent posed as a foreign official from the Government of Argentina.  Tannenbaum's conduct was discovered as a result of his dealing with this undercover agent from 1996 through 1998.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On March 11, 1999, Tannenbaum pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA.  He was ordered to pay a $15,000 criminal fine and sentenced to a one-year prison term, to be followed by three years of supervisory release.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Conspiracy to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions can include circumstances where the ostensible bribe-payer subjectively believes that the intended recipient is a foreign official, even if the recipient is not, in fact, a foreign official.  </li></ul>
