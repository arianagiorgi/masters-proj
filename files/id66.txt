        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Textron Inc. ("Textron")<br />Union Pump S.A.S. (wholly-owned fifth-tier French subsidiary of Textron, formerly known as David Brown Guinard Pumps S.A.S.) ("DB Guinard Pumps"),<br />David Brown Transmissions France S.A. . (wholly-owned fifth-tier French subsidiary of Textron) ("DB Transmissions France")<br />
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Manufacture and sale of industrial pumps, gears and other equipment for the oil, gas and petrochemical industries
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Providence, Rhode Island, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Bangladesh<br />Egypt<br />India<br />Indonesia<br />Iraq<br />United Arab Emirates<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ investigated possible fraud and FCPA books and records violations by several of Textron's French subsidiaries between 2000 and 2003, in connection with the companies activities under the United Nations ("U.N.") Oil for Food Program.  The subsidiaries allegedly paid a total of approximately $600,000 in kickbacks to the Iraqi government by inflating the price of contracts by 10% before submitting the contracts to the U.N. for approval. <br /><br />The SEC charged Textron with violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in connection with the approximately $650,539 in kickback payments made to the Iraqi government under the U.N. Oil for Food Program by two of Textron's French subsidiaries, DB Guinard Pumps and DB Transmissions France.  The kickbacks were made in the form of after-sales service fees ("ASSFs").  <br /><br />DB Guinard Pumps obtained two Oil for Food contracts and funneled $48,000 in ASSF payments through a Lebanese consultant to an Iraqi-controlled bank account in Lebanon.  On a third contract, DB Guinard Pumps authorized, but did not pay, an additional $35,000 in kickbacks.  The payment of the ASSFs were described as consultation fees and recorded as commission payments in DB Guinard Pumps books and records.<br /><br />DB Transmissions France obtained nine Oil for Food contracts and funneled $531,000 in ASSF payments through a Jordanian consulting firm.  On a tenth contract, DB Transmissions France authorized, but did not pay, an additional $35,000 in kickbacks.<br /><br />Both DB Guinard Pumps and DB Transmissions France avoided entering into written agreements (as required by company policy) with their respective consultants in an attempt to shield them companies from the illicit transactions.  <br /><br />According to the SEC complaint, Textron's David Brown subsidiaries in its Industrial Segment made $114,995 in improper payments to foreign officials to secure 36 contracts in the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Egypt, and India from 2001 to 2005.  These payments were structured similarly to the ASSFs paid to the Iraqi government also incorrectly characterized as commissions and consultation fees.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The Independent Inquiry Committee into the U.N. Oil for Food Program named a large number of companies believed to have paid kickbacks to the former Iraqi regime, including Textron subsidiaries.  It is likely that the release of the Independent Inquiry Committees report prompted the DOJ and SEC's investigation.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On August 23, 2007, Textron entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ under which Textron agreed to pay a $1.5 million criminal fine.  According to the DOJ, it agreed not to file criminal charges against the company or its subsidiaries due to Textron's early discovery and reporting of the improper payments; its thorough review of those payments as well as its discovery and review of improper payments made in other countries; and its implementation of enhanced compliance policies and procedures.<br /><br />On the same day, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Textron consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from future violations of the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions.  Textron was ordered to disgorge $2,284,579 in profits, plus $450,461.68 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $800,000.  The company also agreed to comply with certain undertakings with regard to its FCPA compliance program.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Improper payments made to foreign governments and not to specific foreign officials fall outside the scope of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions; still, the FCPA books and records and internal controls provision apply and the DOJ may utilize other laws, such as the mail and wire fraud statutes, to prosecute the conduct.  </li></ul>
