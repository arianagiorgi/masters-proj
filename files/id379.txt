        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Wal-mart describes the initiation of the investigation as follows in its SEC Form 10-K filing on 8 December 2011:<br /><br />"During fiscal 2012, the Company began conducting a voluntary internal review of its policies, procedures and internal controls pertaining to its global anti-corruption compliance program. As a result of information obtained during that review and from other sources, the Company has begun an internal investigation into whether certain matters, including permitting, licensing and inspections, were in compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company has engaged outside counsel and other advisors to assist in the review of these matters and has implemented, and is continuing to implement, appropriate remedial measures. The Company has voluntarily disclosed its internal investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential liability, if any, related to these matters. However, based on the facts currently known, we do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows."<br /><br />By the end of 2012, the company noted in its SEC Form 10-Q, filed on 4 December 2012, that the FCPA investigation had caused the Company to incur expenses of "approximately $48 million and $99 million during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2012."<br /><br />In its Form 8-K submission to the SEC on 21 February 2013, Wal-mart reported that it spent USD 157 million in "professional fees and expenses" related to the FCPA investigation in its last fiscal year. Additionally, it expects to spend USD 40 million to USD 45 million in the first quarter of its next fiscal year on "FCPA and compliance matters." <br /><br />In its Form 10-K submission to the SEC on 26 March 2013, Wal-mart said that "it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters." In an earnings call on 16 May 2013, the Company said that in the first quarter of 2013 it spent "$73 million in expenses related to FCPA matters, which was above our forecasted range of $40 to $45 million. Approximately $44 million of the expenses represent costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while $29 million covers costs regarding the global compliance review, program enhancements and organizational changes."<br /><br />In its quarterly filing 10-Q with the SEC, Wal-mart disclosed that it spent $82 million and $155 million on FCPA and compliance for the three and six months ended 31 July 2013, respectively, bringing its total amount spent to date on FCPA and compliance matters to over USD $300 million.  Of these expenses, approximately $48 million and $92 million, respectively, represent costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $34 million and $63 million, respectively, relate to global compliance programs and organizational enhancements. <br /><br />Walmart's Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on 6 December 2013 states in part: <br /><br />"The Company has been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that it is also the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. The Company is cooperating with the investigations by the DOJ and the SEC. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters.<br /><br />Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors, certain of its current and former officers and certain ofWalmex's current and former officers.<br /><br />The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or its own internal investigations and review. In addition, the Company expects to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred.<br /><br />For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2013, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $69 million and $224 million respectively, related to these matters. Of these expenses, approximately $43 million and $135 million, respectively, represent costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and $26 million and $89 million, respectively, relate to the Company's global compliance program and organizational enhancements. These matters may require the involvement of certain members of the Company's senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to the business. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen."<br /><br />Mexico<br /><br />On 21 April 2012, press reports revealed that an internal investigation of Walmex, formally begun in November 2005, had uncovered millions of dollars in payments to "gestores," agents who took a 6% commission out of the payments and passed the rest on to government officials as bribes.   Sergio Cicero, former attorney at Walmex, claims to have personally sent two outside lawyers working as "gestores" to deliver cash to mayors, city council members, urban planners, all manner of government bureaucrats, and officials in charge of issuing various permits, zoning approvals, licenses, reductions in environmental impact fees, and support from local leaders.  The gestores would submit a record of the payment to the company, using codes on the receipt detailing what each bribe was for and who was getting paid. Later, the company would re-write the payments in their accounting records, showing them as legal fees.  About USD 8.5 million was paid in this way, and approximately USD 16 million was directly paid to government officials.<br /><br />The press reports further allege that Walmex executives, including Eduardo Castro-Wright and other top executives, received a detailed schedule of all of the payments performed.  In addition to Castro-Wright, the reports implicate José Luis Rodríguezmacedo Rivera, general counsel of Walmex.<br /><br />On 23 April 2012, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, announced that they were launching an investigation into the allegations of bribery against Walmart.  Pursuant to that investigation, on 10 January 2013, Congress released three internal emails by Walmart showing that employees within the company knew in October 2005 of the fact that the company had paid at least USD 273,000 in bribes to local officials and businessmen to expedite construction projects in Mexico. <br /><br />On 3 May 2012, the California Teachers' Retirement Fund (CLSTRS), which owns 5.3 million Walmart shares (less than 2% of total shares), filed a derivative action on behalf of Walmart shareholders.  Subsequently, a securities class action was filed in Tennessee, alleging FCPA violations, and ten additional derivative suits were filed in Arkansas and Delaware. <br /><br />On 17 May 2012, the Company filed its quarterly report, Form 8-K, and on 1 June 2012, an SEC Form 10-K, containing identical statements about the ongoing investigations:  <br /><br />"The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the 'Audit Committee'), which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the 'FCPA') and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Walmex') and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters. The Company is also conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance programs through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ') and the SEC.<br /><br />"The Company has been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that it is also the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. The Company is cooperating with the investigations by the DOJ and the SEC. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also recently initiated investigations of these matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have recently been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, its current directors, certain of its former directors, certain of its current and former officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers."<br /><br />The Form 8-K statement goes on to warn investors that there may be negative financial consequences such as the cost of responding to subpoenas for documents, the cost of conducting the investigation, the distraction for management, consumer perceptions, defending the shareholder action, and possible penalties.  An identical statement was made in the company's SEC Form 10-Q filed on 1 June 2012.<br /><br />In a press release issued 20 June 2012, the Company noted that its expansion program in Mexico would be delayed by 60 to 90 days due to "the additional steps the company is adding to its real estate process that extends the average time required to open a store. These steps include reinforcing documentation that supports real estate projects and enhancing processes with our business partners."<br /><br />Walmart also announced in October 2012 that it created a new position, Head of International Legal Compliance, which is to be filled by Daniel Trujillo, whose formal title will be Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer - Walmart International.  In September 2012, the Company disclosed that it had spent USD 51 million on the internal investigation thus far.<br /><br />A New York Times article published on 18 December 2012 makes numerous specific allegations of bribery by Walmex.  The report names bribe givers and bribe recipients, and reveals specific amounts alleged to have been paid for various projects.  For example, four separate payments totaling USD 221,000 were allegedly paid to obtain permits and zoning map changes for the Walmart store in Teotihuacán.  The recipients are alleged to have included the director of urban planning, the mayor, members of the town council, and members of the National Institute of Anthropology and History.  Bribes to erect the Sam's Club in Mexico City allegedly totaled USD 341,000, and a refrigeration and distribution center north of Mexico City is alleged to have cost the company USD 765,000 in bribes.<br /><br />India, Brazil, China, and South Africa<br /><br />In a statement by its attorneys, Walmart identified Brazil, India, China, and South Africa, in addition to Mexico, as areas of particular focus for its investigation.  The Company confirmed that investigations had been undertaken in these jurisdictions in its SEC Form 8-K filed on 15 November 2012, noting also that various Mexican authorities were investigating the corruption allegations.  The Company's statement reads in part:<br /><br />"The Company is also conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance programs through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC'). Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations are reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, conduct inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, open investigations. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets where we operate, including but not limited to Brazil, China and India.<br /><br />"The Company has been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that it is also the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. The Company is cooperating with the investigations by the DOJ and the SEC. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors, certain of its current and former officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers."<br /><br />On 20 November 2012, Bharti Walmart in India suspended five employees.  Media reports allege that one of the suspended employees is Chief Financial Officer Pankaj Madan.  The other four are members of the legal team of the Bharti-Walmart joint venture.  Media reports allege that Walmart India's expansion of both its wholesale and its retail businesses was put on hold pending the corruption investigation. Bharti Walmart, the 50-50 joint venture between Walmart and Bharti Group (permitted since a change in Indian law in September 2012 allowed direct foreign investment up to 51% in Indian enterprises), owns 18 wholesale shops in India; these shops sell goods to retailers, including supermarkets operated by Bharti Retail.<br /><br />According to The Economic Times' report on 12 April 2013, a special inquiry committee was formed in late 2012 to "examine the Bentonville-headquartered retailer's lobbying initiatives vis-a-vis the opening up of India's retail sector, and probe whether the company had bribed any Indian official in this connection. This committee was formed after an uproar in Parliament over Walmart's disclosure that since 2008, it had spent $25 million on lobbying, including on issues related to 'enhanced market access for investment in India.'"<br />

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        United States<br /><br />In 2010, Walmart's general counsel initiated an investigation of compliance in the Company's subsidiaries in Mexico, China, and Brazil.  When the results showed that background checks on third-party agents and other compliance measures required by Company policy were not being carried out, the investigation was expanded to all 26 of Walmart's foreign subsidiaries, beginning in the fall of 2011.<br /><br />Late that year, Walmart learned that the New York Times was investigating specific allegations in Mexico from 2005; the Times published an article on the topic on 21 April 2012.  <br /><br />In 2004, Walmex attorney Sergio Cicero, having been passed over for promotion to general counsel of Walmex, began collecting records of bribes that he himself had organized.  He disclosed the payment schemes to Walmart's attorneys in Arkansas in September 2005.  An investigation was initiated, transferred to local Walmex jurisdiction, and closed.  The Company made public disclosures and reported to the SEC and DOJ after the press first reported the violations.<br /><br />Walmart has since said that it is investigating potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in India, Brazil, and China. <br /><br />India Investigations<br /><br />On 24 January 2013, India's Cabinet announced that it was commissioning a 3-month long special investigation into Walmart's lobbying activities in India.  On 18 May 2013, Business Standard announced that Mukul Mudgal, the former chief judge of Punjab and Haryana High Court who performed the investigation, closed the investigation due to a lack of conclusive evidence that Walmart's lobbying involved bribery.
