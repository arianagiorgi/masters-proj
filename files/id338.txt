        <h1>COMVERSE</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Comverse Technology Inc. ("CTI")<br />Comverse Inc. (CTI's main operating subsidiary)<br />Comverse Ltd. (wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary of Comverse Inc.)
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Global provider of software and software systems for communication and billing services
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        New York, NY, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Greece<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ and SEC charged Comverse Technology Inc. ("CTI") with violating the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions in connection with improper payments made by the company's Israeli operating subsidiary, Comverse Ltd., between 2003 and 2006 to employees connected to Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation S.A. ("OTE"), a telecommunications provider based in Athens, Greece, which is partially owned by the Greek government.  During the period at issue, the Greek government was OTE's largest single shareholder and owned more than one-third of OTE's issued share capital. The government was also OTE's largest customer for telecommunications services.<br /><br />The payments, totaling approximately USD 536,000, were facilitated by a third party agent that created an offshore entity in Cyprus through which to conceal the payments.  The payments, which yielded contracts with OTE worth approximately USD 10 million in revenues and USD 1.2 million in profit, were inaccurately characterized as legitimate agent commissions in the books and records of Comverse Ltd.  The company failed to maintain sufficient internal controls, including failing to conduct due diligence on sales agents or for an independent review of agent contracts outside the sales departments.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        It appears that the conduct ultimately was discovered as a result of an internal security investigation at Comverse Ltd.  Please see the attached SEC Complaint for more details. 
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 7 April 2011, CTI entered into a two-year non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, agreeing to pay a USD 1.2 million criminal fine. CTI agreed to cooperate with the DOJ's ongoing investigation and to implement rigorous internal controls.<br /><br />On the same day, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, CTI consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from violations of the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions.  CTI consented to pay USD 1.6 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>By voluntarily reporting violations of the FCPA and cooperating with the DOJ and SEC, a company may be able to secure reduced penalties, such as a non-prosecution agreement instead of a deferred prosecution agreement.</li><li>Employees of a partially state-owned enterprise may be deemed "foreign officials" under the FCPA depending on the level of ownership and control exercised by the government at issue.</li></ul>
