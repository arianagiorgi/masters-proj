        Finland: District Court of Mustasaari<br />Finland: Office of the Prosecutor General<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Wärtsilä Corporation ("Wärtsilä")<br />Wärtsilä Finland Oy ("Wärtsilä Finland," Vaasa-based subsidiary of Wärtsilä)<br />Former Senior Manager of Wärtsilä Finland
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Power solutions for marine and energy markets

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        On October 23, 2009, charges of aggravated bribery were brought against Wärtsilä Finland's former Senior Manager at the District Court of Mustasaari in Finland.  The public prosecutor also demanded a corporate fine of at least EUR 500,000 from Wärtsilä's subsidiary, Wärtsilä Finland, in the same context.  <br /><br />The alleged bribes were supposedly made in connection with a power plant tender in Kenya in 1997.  The power plant was delivered in 2001.  The public prosecutor claimed that the Senior Manager made improper payments amounting to EUR 3.4 million to a Kenyan officer working as the Managing Director and President of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company.  <br /><br />In addition to the corporate fine, the public prosecutor has demanded the economic benefits from the project, EUR 3.4 million, to be forfeited to the State. Wärtsilä considers the demands unfounded and Wärtsilä Finland's former Senior Manager has denied the charges brought against him.
