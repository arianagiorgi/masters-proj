        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        On 9 July 1979, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against International Systems & Controls Corporation and five of its officers and employees, alleging that they violated the FCPA's accounting provisions by making over USD 23 million in improper payments between 1970-1977 to government officials and royal family members in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Algeria, Ivory Coast, Nicaragua, Chile and other countries (reportedly) - through subsidiaries - in order to obtain contracts related to engineering and constructing projects.  The payments were allegedly concealed on ISC's books as consulting fees, consulting services, and agent's fees and commission.  ISC's internal controls failed to require documentation to back up the expenditures. <br /><br />The SEC complaint also charged the defendants with anti-fraud, proxy, and reporting violations.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Unspecified
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        In December 1979, ISC, Kenneally and Frietsch, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, consented to the entry of a final order enjoining future violations of the federal securities laws.   ISC was required to appoint a special agent to oversee the company books and records and overseas business activities. 
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Although many of the improper payments took place prior to the passage of the FCPA in 1977, the SEC claimed that ISC violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading financial statements in connection with the payments..</li><li>As described in the SEC complaint, it is possible that a company commits foreign bribery in spite of efforts by the host government's to stop the activity.</li></ul>
