The contracts with the governments of Georgia, Senegal and Syria were also allegedly secured through kickbacks to government officials in the respective countries.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        In February 2008, the Chief Financial Officer of Imprimerie Nationale refused to approve the accounts of Imprimerie Nationale for the year ending 31 December 2007 because of the lack of clarity as to the role played by a company called "Wed Pascal Pluchard" in obtaining contracts with several foreign States.  An audit of Imprimerie Nationale's export contracts was thereafter conducted by KPMG, who concluded that there were serious reasons for presumptions of corruption. <br /><br />The Agence des Participations de l'Etat, the French agency which controls the French State's participation in Imprimerie Nationale, filed a complaint with the Public Prosecutor.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        A Paris Investigating Magistrate was appointed in 2008 and the Attorney General of Paris began a preliminary investigation in July 2009.  It appears that the investigation is ongoing.
