        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Flowserve Corporation ("Flowserve")<br />Flowserve Pompes S.A.S. (wholly-owned French subsidiary of Flowserve) ("Flowserve Pompes")<br />Flowserve B.V. (wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary of Flowserve) <br />

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        From approximately 2001 through 2003, Flowserve Corporation, through its French and Dutch subsidiaries, Flowserve Pompes SAS and Flowserve B.V., respectively, entered into over twenty contracts in which USD 646,488 in kickback payments (described as after-sales service fees ("ASSFs")) were made and another USD 173,758 were authorized in connection with the sale of large-scale water pumps and spare parts for use in oil refineries to the Iraqi government under the United Nations ("U.N.") Oil for Food Program.  The payments went through a Jordanian agent before they reached the Iraqi-controlled account in a Jordanian bank. <br /><br />Senior executives at Flowserve Pompes concealed the payments by falsely indicating that they were paying the Jordanian agent a 10% service fee on each contract to cover the cost of installing and commissioning the equipment, even though no services were performed under the contracts.  Flowserve B.V. used a separate Jordanian entity to act as its agent for its transactions and concealed the payments by increasing the cost of the purchase orders by 10% and passing the difference back to the agent.  Flowserve B.V. also agreed to pay a special project discount to the agent in order to cover the amount of the kickbacks.  This discount thus effectively doubled the agents commission to 20%.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The Independent Inquiry Committee into the U.N. Oil for Food Program named a large number of companies believed to have paid kickbacks to the former Iraqi regime, including subsidiaries of Flowserve.  It is likely that the release of the Independent Inquiry Committees report prompted the DOJ and SEC's investigation.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 21 February 2008, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Flowserve consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining the company from future violations of the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions.  Flowserve was ordered to disgorge USD 2,720,861 in profits, plus USD 853,364 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of USD 3 million.  <br /><br />On the same day, Flowserve entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ in connection with a criminal information filed against Flowserve Pompes, charging the subsidiary with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the FCPA's books and records provisions.  Flowserve accepted responsibility for the actions of its subsidiary and agreed to a USD 4 million criminal fine.  <br /><br />According to the SEC, Flowserve B.V. was to enter into a criminal disposition with the Dutch Public Prosecutor pursuant to which it will pay a fine.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Improper payments made to foreign governments and not to specific foreign officials fall outside the scope of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions; still, the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provision apply and the DOJ may utilize other laws, such as the mail and wire fraud statutes, to prosecute the conduct.  </li></ul>
