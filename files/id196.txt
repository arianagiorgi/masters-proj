        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Global Crossing Limited ("Global Crossing")<br />Impsat Fiber Networks, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Impsat")
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Global Internet protocol (IP)-based telecommunications carrier 
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Hamilton, Bermuda
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Colombia<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Global Crossing described the ongoing investigation as follows in its 2009 SEC Form 10-K:<br /><br />"We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the 'FCPA') and other anticorruption laws, and our failure to comply therewith could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. <br /><br />"We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and agents comply with the FCPA, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations. As previously disclosed, between 2004 and 2006 (prior to our acquisition of Impsat in May 2007), Impsat paid approximately $23,000 (based on the exchange rate at the time of payment) to government officials to allow performance of construction work notwithstanding the fact that required permits were not obtained. Also as previously disclosed, the Colombian National Attorney General (Procuraduría General de la Nación ('NAG')) published a decision in November 2007 finding (as part of broader allegations unrelated to Impsat) that funds originated with Impsat had been used by a contractor retained by Impsat to bribe an official within Colombia's homeland security agency (Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad ('DAS')).<br /><br />"Impsat retained the contractor in question in 2003 and paid him approximately $44,000 (based on the exchange rate at the time of payment) in 2004; we have not been able to determine whether any of these funds went to DAS officials. The NAG's decision included a referral of the report and its findings to the criminal prosecutor, and the referral included specific reference to Impsat. One DAS official has been criminally convicted in connection with a related investigation, and criminal proceedings are pending against two other individuals (including a former senior official at DAS). We have brought these matters to the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has commenced a preliminary inquiry into the matter. We are cooperating with that inquiry, which may result in legal action. At this point we are unable to predict the duration, scope or result of that inquiry. We also notified the U. S. Department of Justice. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations."<br /><br />Global Crossing provided the following update  in its SEC Form 10-K-A filed on 28 February 2011:<br /><br />"We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the 'FCPA') and other anticorruption laws, and our failure to comply therewith could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.<br /> <br />"We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential anticorruption violations. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.<br /> <br />"The U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the 'Bribery Act'), which is expected to come into force in 2011, will reform the U.K. law in relation to bribery. As well as containing provisions concerning bribery of public officials, the Bribery Act introduces a new criminal offence of failing to prevent bribery by relevant commercial organizations. This offense applies when any person associated with the organization offers or accepts bribery anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain a business advantage for the organization or in the conduct of business. The Bribery Act has wide ranging implications in particular for business in the U.K., including GCUK and our other U.K. subsidiaries. However, it should be noted that it also has a wide-ranging extra-territorial effect. The Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the FCPA. Under the Bribery Act, it will be a defense to the accusation of failure to prevent bribery for a commercial organization to show that it had in place 'adequate procedures' designed to prevent such acts. The U.K. Ministry of Justice plans to publish guidance on the meaning of 'adequate procedures' in advance of the date the Bribery Act comes into effect."<br /><br />Global Crossing was acquired by Level 3 Communications on 3 October 2011.
