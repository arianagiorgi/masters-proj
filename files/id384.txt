        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        In January 2012, Kazuo Okada, a member of the board of directors of Wynn Resorts and in control of approximately 20% of Wynn Resort's shares, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against Wynn Resorts in Clark County District Court in Nevada, requesting that Wynn Resorts make its books and records available for the inspection of Mr. Okada, which it had refused to do upon formal request by Mr. Okada in November 2011.  The complaint alleges that beginning in 1999 or 2000, Mr. Okada provided funding for Wynn Resort's resort development projects, and that approximately USD 135 million of these funds were pledged by Wynn Macau to the University of Macau Development Foundation. The contribution is alleged to have consisted of a USD 25 million donation made in May 2011, and a commitment of additional donations of USD 10 million for each of the years between 2012 and 2022, when the concession received by Wynn Macau to build and operate a casino was scheduled to expire.  <br /><br />Wynn announced that on 8 February 2012, "following Mr. Okada's lawsuit, the company received a letter from the Salt Lake Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requesting that, in connection with an informal inquiry by the SEC, the company preserve information relating to the donation to the University of Macau, any donations by the company to any other educational charitable institutions, including the University of Macau Development Foundation, and the company's casino or concession gaming licenses or renewals in Macau. The company intends to fully comply with the SEC's request."<br /><br />In an additional statement, Wynn noted, "Wynn Resorts Ltd., made a commitment to the University of Macau Development Foundation in support of the new Asia-Pacific Academy of Economics and Management. This contribution consists of a $25 million payment made in May 2011 and a commitment for additional donations of $10 million each year for the calendar years 2012 through 2022 inclusive. The pledge was consistent with the company's long-standing practice of providing philanthropic support for deserving institutions in the markets in which it operates. The pledge was made following an extensive analysis which concluded that the gift was made in accordance with all applicable laws. The pledge was considered by the Boards of Directors of both the company and Wynn Macau and approved by 15 of the 16 directors who serve on those boards. The sole dissenting vote was Mr. Kazuo Okada whose stated objection was to the length of time over which the donation would occur, not its propriety."<br /><br />Reuters reported on 10 April 2013 that the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") filed a motion to intervene in a law suit in a Nevada state court between Okada and Wynn Resorts "to prevent disrupting an ongoing criminal probe into the bribery allegations." The story said that the filing disclosed that the DOJ has initiated investigation of the company's donation to the University of Macau. <br /><br />Additional details regarding the bribery allegations against Mr. Okada and his companies are found in the Compendium entries entitled "Universal Entertainment Corp."

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The allegations were disclosed in Okada's January 2012 complaint filed against Wynn requesting full disclosure of Wynn Resorts' financial transactions, including contributions to the University of Macau.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        According to a Wall Street Journal story from 9 July 2013, the SEC has told Wynn Resorts that is has decided to not recommend formal civil enforcement against the company regarding the donation to the University of Macau. <br /><br />The DOJ's investigation is ongoing.
