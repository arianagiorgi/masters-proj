        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Strabag SE ("Strabag")<br />Studi International SA (Tunisia-based engineering contractor) ("Studi")
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports, in 2009 the former Permanent Secretary in Rwanda's Ministry of Infrastructure, Vincent Gatwadbuyenge, was arrested in connection with allegations surrounding his approval of a RWF 1.7 billion (USD 2.998 million) payment to Strabag for engineering services the company may never have provided under its construction contract for the Kigali-Bugesera road project.  An employee from Strabag was also arrested in connection with the Rwanda National Public Prosecution Authority's investigation. <br /><br />Two employees of Studi International were also arrested in connection with the investigation into the Kigali-Bugesera road project.  Studi International was responsible for supervising the construction of the road.<br /><br />It appears that Strabag may also be under investigation in Germany and Hungary for possible bribery  in connection with road construction projects in those two countries.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Unspecified
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        The investigations appear to be ongoing. <br /><br />In February 2011, the World Bank withdrew its funding for a Strabag-led consortium to lead the Nairobi Toll Road project over concerns related to the company's ability to meet integrity benchmarks.  It appears that the Chinese government will take over the funding for the Kenyan project.  It is not clear whether the World Bank's concerns were related to Strabag's activities in Rwanda, as discussed above.
