Between 2002 and 2007, the Greens allegedly paid approximately USD 1.8 million in bribes to former governor Siriwan through numerous bank accounts in Singapore, the UK and the Isle of Jersey that were held in the name of Siriwan's daughter (Jittisopa Siriwan) and Siriwan's friend.  The Green's businesses earned over USD 13.5 million in revenue as a result of the contracts obtained.<br /><br />According to evidence presented at trial, the Greens, in furtherance of the conspiracy, utilized a variety of business entities, some of which had dummy business addresses and telephone numbers, in their communications with TAT in an effort to conceal the large amount of money that was being paid under the contracts.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The Greens were arrested on 18 December 2007 on charges of conspiring to pay more than USD 1.7 million in bribes to former TAT governor Siriwan in return for the contracts to administer the annual Bangkok International Film Festival.  On 1 October 2008, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment adding new charges alleging bribery of Siriwan in exchange for the elite privilege card contracts, as well as money laundering charges and allegations that Mrs. Green knowingly subscribed two false U.S. corporate income tax returns.  <br /><br />
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 11 September 2009, following a two-and-a-half week trial in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, a federal jury found Gerald and Patricia Green guilty of conspiracy and substantive violations of the FCPA and money laundering laws.  Patricia Green was also found guilty of falsely subscribing U.S. income tax returns in connection with the same set of conduct.  <br /><br />The conspiracy and substantive FCPA charges each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, while each of the money laundering charges carry a maximum penalty of up to twenty years in prison.  The false subscription of a U.S. income tax return charge carries a three-year maximum penalty and a fine not greater than USD 100,000.  In its 14 December 2009 response to the pre-sentence report for Gerald Green, the government argued that his sentencing range should be life in prison.  <br /><br />On 12 August 2010, the Greens were each sentenced to six months in prison followed by six months of home confinement and were each ordered to pay USD 250,000 in restitution.  After serving their six month terms, they were released from federal custody in May 2011.  The government initially appealed the short sentences but then withdrew the appeal on 23 August 2011.  The government did win a forfeiture count, leaving the Greens indigent.  The Greens appealed the restitution order of USD 250,000 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,  and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court ruling on 11 July 2013. <br /><br />On 19 January 2010, an indictment against former TAT governor Juthamas Siriwan and her daughter, Jittisopa Siriwan, was unsealed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.  The indictment charges the Siriwans with conspiracy to commit money laundering, transporting funds to promote unlawful activity (bribery of a foreign official), and aiding and abetting.  If convicted, they each face up to twenty years in prison.  Juthamas Siriwan also faces prosecution in Thailand. <br /><br />On 11 January 2013, prosecutors in the U.S. filed a supplemental brief asking that the charges against Siriwan and her daughter, Jittsopa Siriwan, remain open pending the unfreezing of extradition proceedings in Thailand.  The extradition process was put on hold while Thai authorities prepare their own case against the Siriwans.  In their court filing, U.S. prosecutors noted that they had received a diplomatic note on 14 December explaining that the Anti-Corruption Commission of Thailand was planning to file criminal charges against Juthamas Siriwan.<br /><br />

The false subscription of a U.S. income tax return charge carries a three-year maximum penalty and a fine not greater than USD 100,000.  In its 14 December 2009 response to the pre-sentence report for Gerald Green, the government argued that his sentencing range should be life in prison.  <br /><br />On 12 August 2010, the Greens were each sentenced to six months in prison followed by six months of home confinement and were each ordered to pay USD 250,000 in restitution.  After serving their six month terms, they were released from federal custody in May 2011.  The government initially appealed the short sentences but then withdrew the appeal on 23 August 2011.  The government did win a forfeiture count, leaving the Greens indigent.  The Greens appealed the restitution order of USD 250,000 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,  and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court ruling on 11 July 2013. <br /><br />On 19 January 2010, an indictment against former TAT governor Juthamas Siriwan and her daughter, Jittisopa Siriwan, was unsealed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.  The indictment charges the Siriwans with conspiracy to commit money laundering, transporting funds to promote unlawful activity (bribery of a foreign official), and aiding and abetting.  If convicted, they each face up to twenty years in prison.  Juthamas Siriwan also faces prosecution in Thailand. <br /><br />On 11 January 2013, prosecutors in the U.S. filed a supplemental brief asking that the charges against Siriwan and her daughter, Jittsopa Siriwan, remain open pending the unfreezing of extradition proceedings in Thailand.  The extradition process was put on hold while Thai authorities prepare their own case against the Siriwans.  In their court filing, U.S. prosecutors noted that they had received a diplomatic note on 14 December explaining that the Anti-Corruption Commission of Thailand was planning to file criminal charges against Juthamas Siriwan.<br /><br />
