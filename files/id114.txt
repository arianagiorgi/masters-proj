        <h1>ASHLAND OIL</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Ashland Oil, Inc.  ("Ashland Oil")<br />Ashland Development Inc. (wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland Oil) ("ADI")<br />Orin E. Atkins (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ashland Oil)
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Refining, transporting and marketing of crude oil products 
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Lexington, Kentucky, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Oman<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) charged Ashland Oil and Orin E. Atkins, its Chairman and CEO, with violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions in connection with improper payments allegedly made to government officials in Oman between 1979 and 1981.  <br /><br />Starting in late 1979, Ashland Oil, Inc., through its subsidiary Ashland Development Inc., made USD 29 million in improper payments to James Langdon, a British Army officer seconded to Oman (and hence an official of Oman for purposes of the FCPA) in return for crude oil contracts from Oman's government.  <br /><br />ADI began investing in Midland Chrome Mines (Private) Ltd., a company in Zimbabwe owned by Langdon and his family.  Over the next few years, ADI made approximately USD 25 million in payments and USD 4 million in interest by acquiring a 75% ownership interest in Midland Mines.  The mines themselves, due to a hostile political atmosphere in Zimbabwe and technical problems in removing the minerals, among other reasons, ultimately proved a worthless investment.  <br /><br />In return for the payments, Langdon used his influence with the Sultan of Oman to aid Ashland Oil in the procurement of crude contracts at a reduced price.  Central in these negotiations was Atkins, who approved many of the payments and proceeded with the dealings despite warnings from company lawyers and managers about possible FCPA violations.  <br /><br />In late 1983, shareholders filed suit against directors and officers of Ashland Oil for alleging waste of company funds in connection with the mine in Zimbabwe.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Unspecified
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 8 July 1986, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ashland Oil and Orin Atkins each consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Investing in a company owned by a foreign official or an official's family may constitute an improper payment under the FCPA if the investment is intended to influence the official in order to obtain an improper advantage. </li></ul>
