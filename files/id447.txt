        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        NIGERIA<br /><br />Bilfinger and Houston-based Willbros Group Inc. conspired from 2003 through June 2005 to pay more than USD $6 million in bribes to Nigerian government officials to help get and keep contracts related to the Eastern Gas Gathering System project, worth USD $387 million.  Bilfinger and Willbros had entered into a joint venture to bid on the project, and allegedly inflated the price of the bid by 3% to cover the cost of the bribes, which Bilfinger paid with cash sent from Germany to Nigeria.<br /><br />When Willbros employees encountered difficulty obtaining enough money to make their share of the bribe payments, Bilfinger loaned them $1 million, with the express purpose of paying bribes to the Nigerian officials.<br /><br /><br />EASTERN EUROPE <br /><br />German authorities from the Landshut prosecutor's office raided the offices of Bilfinger in October 2012, investigating allegations of bribery in various countries in Eastern Europe in 2007 and 2008.  Reports alleged that the prosecutors are focusing on four suspects who had dealings in Hungary and Slovakia.  Three of the individuals are German, and worked for the unit of Bilfinger based in Passau.  They are suspected of organizing bribe payments of EUR 5 to 6 million.<br /><br />Prosecutors from  Austria, Slovakia and Hungary are also reported to be involved in the investigation. <br /><br /><br />BRAZIL<br /><br />According to a press release issued by Bilfinger, improper payments from employees of a Brazil Bilfinger affiliate were allegedly made to employees of state companies and public officials in Brazil. The allegedly improper payments were related to orders for monitor walls and software for security control centers in several Brazilian municipalities. The orders were valued at approximately $6.5 million.<br />
