        <h1>ACCENTURE</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Accenture plc ("Accenture")
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company 
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Dublin, Ireland
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Unspecified<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Accenture describes the ongoing investigation as follows in a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-K:<br /><br />"As previously reported, in July 2003, we became aware of an incident of possible noncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and/or with Accenture's internal controls in connection with certain of our operations in the Middle East. In 2003, we voluntarily reported the incident to the appropriate authorities in the United States promptly after its discovery. Shortly thereafter, the SEC advised us it would be undertaking an informal investigation of this incident, and the DOJ indicated it would also conduct a review. Since that time, there have been no further developments. We do not believe that this incident will have any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition."<br /><br />In April 2007, the DOJ intervened in a whistleblower ("Qui Tam") action accusing Accenture of receiving kickbacks on government contracts within the US.  This suit did not involve international bribery, and was settled by Accenture, which, denying any guilt, agreed to pay USD 63.675 million, in consideration for the release of all claims alleged by the government in September 2011.<br />
