        <h1>SMITH & NEPHEW</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Smith & Nephew plc ("Smith & Nephew" or S&N plc)<br />Smith & Nephew, Inc. (S&N Inc), a subsidiary of S&N plc incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee<br />Smith & Nephew GmbH (S&N GmbH), a subsidiary of S&N plc headquartered in Tuttlingen, Germany
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Medical device company focusing on orthopedics, wound care and endoscopy
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        London, United Kingdom
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Unspecified<br />Greece<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The investigation was first made public by Smith & Nephew, when the company described the ongoing investigation in general terms in its SEC Form 20-F filed on 3 March 2011.  <br /><br />Then, in a civil complaint filed on 6 February 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Smith & Nephew plc), the following allegations are made:<br /><br />In 1997 and 1998, S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH entered into agreements with a Greek distributor.  The Greek distributor would purchase S&N orthopedic products at the full, rather than the discounted, price.   S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH would then use a portion of the sales price to pay two shell companies set up in the UK by the Greek distributor.  These payments were listed in the companies' records as marketing expenses, but in fact were used by the Greek distributor to pay bribes to doctors in Greece as incentives to purchase the S&N products, with the knowledge of executives at S&N Inc. and S&N GmbH.  The complaint also states that doctors in Greece are foreign officials within the meaning of the FCPA, as they are public employees within Greece's national healthcare system.    <br /><br />The complaint requests a permanent injunction to restrain S&N plc from violating the law, and disgorgement of the benefits gained by illegally inducing doctors to purchase S&N products.<br /><br />A criminal information filed on 6 February 2012 in connection with the deferred prosecution agreement described below makes the same factual allegations.
