        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Nigeria<br /><br />Snamprogetti Netherlands BV ("Snamprogetti") was part of the four-company "TSKJ" joint venture [Technip of France; Snamprogetti; KBR of the U.S.; and JGC Corporation of Japan] that was alleged to have paid hundreds of millions in bribes to Nigerian officials between 1995 and 2004 in order to secure four engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for the development of liquefied natural gas facilities on Bonny Island in Nigeria.  The joint venture operated in Nigeria through three Portuguese special purpose corporations.  The value of the contracts to TSKJ was over USD 6 billion.  <br /><br />Snamprogetti allegedly authorized the joint venture's hiring of two agents (Jeffrey Tesler and a Japanese trading company) through which improper payments were made to various Nigerian government officials, including top-level executive branch officials.  The joint venture paid over USD 180 million to these two agents during the course of the bribery scheme.  <br /><br />During the time period at issue, Snamprogetti, which is headquartered in Amsterdam, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Snamprogetti SpA, an Italian EPC company headquartered in Milan.  Snamprogetti SpA was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eni SpA.  Snamprogetti was merged into Saipem SpA ("Saipem") in 2008.  Eni holds a 43% stake in Saipem.  Eni itself is 30% owned by the Italian government.  Eni became a U.S. issuer in 1995.<br /><br />Allegations of bribery unrelated to the TSKJ consortium have also arisen. <br /><br />Kazakhstan<br /><br />In November 2007, the company's subsidiary Agip KCO NV became the subject of an inquiry by the  Public Prosecutor of Kazakhastan concerning bribes paid in connection to a contract awarded to the Overseas International Constructors GmbH.  In April 2010, a settlement was proposed, but then on 4 March 2011, the Finance Police of Kazakhstan agreed to dismiss the matter altogether.  However, the Public Prosecutor of Milan is investigating the matter, having requesting documents from Eni.  The tax police of Milan asked to interview Eni managers connected with Agip KCO and the NCC and OIC consortia.  This investigation is ongoing.<br /><br />Algeria<br /><br />The Public Prosecutor of Milan also informed Eni on 4 February 2011, of a request for documents related to the Saipem/Sonatrach contract of June 2009 concerning ground engineering on the GK3 gas pipeline.  <br /><br />Libya<br /><br />On 10 June 2011, the SEC served Eni with a subpoena for the collection of documents relating to Eni's activity in Libya between 2009 and 2011.  No allegations more specific than "certain illicit payments to Libyan officials" have been made, but in December 2011, the SEC expanded the scope of the subpoenaed documents.  According to Eni's SEC Form 20-F filed on 5 April 2012, the company is cooperating fully with the SEC.<br /><br />Iraq and Kuwait<br /><br />A search warrant was issued to search the offices and homes of employees of the Eni Zubair group and one Saipem manager, on 21 June 2011.  In Eni's Form 20-F filing with the SEC on 5 April 2012, the company states, "The accusation is of criminal conspiracy and corruption in relation with the activity of Eni Zubair in Iraq and of Saipem in the 'Jurassic' project in Kuwait.  The Public Prosecutor of Milan as associated Eni Zubair, Eni and Saipem with the accusations as a result of the alleged illicit actions of their employees."  Eni claims that neither Eni SpA nor Eni Zubair had anything to do with the illicit conduct, that it was disloyal, rogue employees who engaged in corrupt behavior.  Eni therefore hired outside auditors to conduct an audit of related issues.  Meanwhile, Eni's internal review revealed no problems, and so one of the suspect employees, who had been discharged by Saipem, was reemployed in a different capacity.  On 2 March 2012, Saipem SpA was notified by the Public Prosecutor (of Milan) that the investigation would continue.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        According to press reports, the Nigeria LNG bribery scandal first came to light during the course of investigations by French prosecutors into Elf-Aquitaine's operations in Asia and Africa.<br /><br />Eni described the (at the time ongoing) investigation as follows its 2009 Annual Report:<br /><br />"Snamprogetti Netherlands BV has a 25% participation in the TSKJ Consortium companies. The remaining participations are held in equal shares of 25% by Halliburton/KBR, Technip, and JGC. Beginning in 1994 the TSKJ Consortium has been involved in the construction of natural gas liquefaction facilities at Bonny Island in Nigeria. Snamprogetti SpA, the holding company of Snamprogetti Netherlands BV, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Eni until February 2006, when an agreement was entered into for the sale of Snamprogetti to Saipem SpA and Snamprogetti was merged into Saipem as of October 1, 2008. Eni holds a 43% participation in Saipem. In connection with the sale of  Snamprogetti to Saipem, Eni agreed to indemnify Saipem for a variety of matters, including potential losses and charges resulting from the investigations into the TSKJ matter referred to below, even in relation to Snamprogetti subsidiaries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), and other authorities, including the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan, are investigating alleged improper payments made by the TSKJ Consortium to certain Nigerian public officials. The proceedings in the US: beginning in June 2004, Eni and Saipem/Snamprogetti have been voluntarily providing information in response to requests by the SEC and the DoJ in connection with the investigations. In February 2009, KBR and its former parent company, Halliburton, announced that they had reached a settlement with the SEC and the DoJ with respect to the TSKJ matter as well as other unspecified matters. KBR/Halliburton pleaded guilty to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) charges, for the conduct stemming from their participation in TSKJ, and they have agreed to pay a criminal fine of $402 million to the DOJ and a civil penalty of $177 million to the SEC. In view of the agreements entered into by KBR/Halliburton with the DoJ and SEC, the TSKJ matter could result in legal liability on the part of individuals as well as the other members of the TSKJ Consortium Entities found in violation of the FCPA, and those entities could be subject to substantial fines and the imposition of ongoing measures by the US government to prevent future violations, including potentially a monitor of internal controls, and debarment from government contracts.<br /><br />"In a press release of February 12, 2010, the French company Technip announced, as a result of the circumstances that its discussions with US authorities have intensified over the last weeks, the recognition of a provision for an amount of €245 million reflecting the estimated cost of resolution with such Authorities.  The decision was made according to the status of ongoing discussions with DoJ and SEC that allowed Technip to estimate a global resolution of all potential claims against the company arising from the investigation. <br /><br />"As to Eni, the contacts with the US authorities have been intensified recently. Based on the ongoing status of the discussions, the Company has been able to estimate the cost of a global resolution of all potential claims arising from the investigation with the US authorities, similarly to Technip. As a result of this, a provision of €250,000,000 has been accrued, also considering the contractual obligations assumed by Eni to indemnify Saipem as part of the divestment of Snamprogetti. Discussions with the US authorities are underway. <br /><br />"The proceedings in Italy: beginning in 2004, the TSKJ matter has prompted investigations by the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan against unknown persons. Since March 10, 2009, the company received requests of exhibition of documents by the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan. On July 17, 2009, the date on which a search and attachment warrant was served on Saipem/ Snamprogetti, the Public Prosecutor's office of Milan indicated to the company that it is investigating one or more people, including at least one former manager of Snamprogetti; previously, as far as the company knew, nobody was under formal investigation. The events under investigation cover the period since 1994 and also concern the period of time subsequent to the June 8, 2001 enactment of the Italian legislative decree n. 231 concerning the liability of legal entities. A violation of legislative decree June 8, 2001 n. 231 can result in the confiscation of criminal profits in addition to administrative penalties. During the preliminary investigations, the preventive attachment of such profits and other precautionary measures are possible. On July 31, 2009, a decree issued by the Judge for Preliminary Investigation at the Court of Milan was served on Saipem SpA (as legal entity incorporating Snamprogetti SpA). The decree sets for September 22, 2009 a hearing in Court in relation to a proceeding ex Legislative Decree no. 231 of June 8, 2001 whereby the Public prosecutor of Milan is investigating Eni SpA and Saipem SpA for liability of legal entities arising from offences involving international corruption charged to two former managers of Snamprogetti SpA. The Public Prosecutor of Milan requested Eni SpA and Saipem SpA to be debarred from activities involving – directly or indirectly –any agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries. The above mentioned hearing allow Eni and Saipem to conduct own defence before any decision is made on the requested disqualification. The events referred to the request of precautionary measures of the Public Prosecutor of Milan cover TSKJ Consortium practices in the period from 1995 to 2004. To this regard, the Public Prosecutor claims the inadequacy and violation of the organizational, management and control Model adopted to prevent those offences charged to people subject to direction and supervision. At the time of the events under investigation, the company had adopted a code of practice and internal procedures with reference to the best practices at the time. Subsequently, such code and internal procedures have been improved aiming at the continuous improvement of internal controls. Furthermore, on March 14, 2008 Eni approved a new Code of Ethics and a new Model 231 reaffirming that the belief that one is acting in favour or to the advantage of Eni can never, in any way, justify – not even in part – any behaviours that conflict with the principles and contents of the Code. Since April 23, 2009, with regard to investigations on the TSKJ matter the Company's Board of Directors has timely recalled the analysis of the existing internal procedures against corruption, in order to implement any upgrading to be possibly needed, and to continue the cooperation with the relevant authorities and also resolved to promote all legal measures for protecting the Company's interests and reputation, in case the responsibility of its employees or collaborators is verified. The jury room of September 22, 2009 has been postponed to the hearing of October 21, 2009 when the judge for the preliminary investigation rejected the request of precautionary measures of disqualification filed by the Public Prosecutor of Milan against Eni and Saipem. The Public Prosecutor of Milan appealed the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigation. The hearing for the review of the appeal, scheduled initially for January 20, 2010 has been anticipated, through a measure communicated to the defence on January 12, 2010, on January 19, 2010 when the Judge of Re-examination dismissed as unfounded the appeal of the Public Prosecutor. In February 19, 2010 the Public Prosecutor of Milan filed an appeal with the Third Instance Court, asking for the cancellation of the above mentioned decision of the Judge of Re-examination. At the same time in February 11, 2010 the Public Prosecutor of Milan requested, according to article 248 of Penal Code the collection of documentation and information related to companies participated by Eni S.p.A and Saipem S.p.A (former Snamprogetti S.p.A) involved in Bonny Island project."
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        United States<br /><br />In February 2009 Halliburton and KBR settled FCPA charges related to its involvement in the scheme, resulting in USD 579 million in combined penalties.  The DOJ and SEC have been investigating other joint venture partners since.  On 28 June 2010, Technip settled with the DOJ and SEC for a total of USD 338 million in penalties.  <br /><br />On 7 July 2010, the DOJ filed a deferred prosecution agreement and two-count information against Snamprogetti in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charging the company with one count of conspiracy and one count of aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA.  Under the terms of the two-year deferred prosecution agreement, Snamprogetti agreed to pay a USD 240 million criminal fine and  Snamprogetti, Saipem and Eni agreed to ensure that their compliance programs satisfied certain standards and agreed to cooperate with the DOJ's ongoing investigations.  <br /><br />On the same day, Snamprogetti and Eni reached a settlement of a related civil complaint with the SEC.  Snamprogetti was charged with violating the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions, falsifying books and records and circumventing internal controls .  Eni was charged with violating the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the companies agreed to the entry of court orders permanently enjoining them from future violations of the respective securities law provisions.  Snamprogetti and Eni agreed to jointly pay USD 125 million in disgorgement of profits and prejudgment interest.  <br /><br />At the conclusion of the two-year deferral period, on 19 September 2012, all charges against the Company in the U.S. were dropped, definitively concluding U.S. criminal proceedings against Snamprogetti Netherlands BV for conduct connected with the TSKJ consortium's work on Bonny Island.  In a press release announcing dismissal of the charges, the Company listed its anti-corruption accomplishments, including the application of "groundbreaking anti-corruption control systems" and becoming "an international reference for best practices in anti-corruption. "<br /><br />Italy<br /><br />The long-running matter with the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office remains ongoing.  On  31 July and 12 August 2009, complaints were served on Saipem/Snamprogetti, but procedural issues relating to the admission of evidence and the application of conflicting statutes of limitations prevented the case from moving forward.   In a 26 January 2011 hearing, the public prosecutor served indictments on five former employees; preliminary hearings took place in May 2011.  Then, on 2 February 2012, it was determined that the statute of limitations conflict between Italian law and the requirements of the OECD convention must be addressed, and at a subsequent hearing, on 8 March 2012, resolution of the issue was postponed until 5 April 2012.  Meanwhile, information published in ENI's  20-F filed with the SEC on 5 April 2012 revealed that on 24 January 2012 the Judge for Preliminary Hearings set aside part of the proceedings, dismissing the case as against nine employees and former employees of Eni (relating to failure to pay excise duties).  The tax authorities reduced the amount originally claimed by the public prosecutor to EUR 114 million in unpaid taxes.   <br /><br />Nigeria<br /><br />The press reported that Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ("EFCC") had arrested ten Halliburton employees in Nigeria during a raid of the offices of Halliburton Energy Services Nigeria Limited in Lagos on 25 November 2010.   The EFCC also arrested one employee each from Saipem Contracting Nigeria and Technip Offshore Nigeria.  On 7 December 2010, the EFCC reportedly filed corruption charges against Halliburton, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney (who was the CEO of Halliburton during the period at issue), Albert Stanley (former CEO of KBR), David Lesar (current CEO of Halliburton) and William Utt (current CEO of KBR).  Technip, Snamprogetti and JGC Corp. were reportedly also charged on the same day.  The case number is Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Halliburton and others, CV/435/10, High Court of Justice, Abuja Judicial Division (Abuja).<br /><br />According to press reports, on 15 December 2010, Halliburton and the EFCC reached a USD 250 million settlement agreement to resolve the charges.  Halliburton will pay USD 120 million in penalties and USD 130 million in frozen assets in Switzerland will be repatriated to Nigeria.  In exchange, Nigeria dropped the charges.  Former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker reportedly assisted with the negotiations.  <br /><br />On 20 December 2010, Saipem announced that Snamprogetti had entered into a settlement agreement and non-prosecution agreement with the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the investigation.  Snamprogetti agreed to the payment of a criminal penalty of USD 30 million, along with USD 2.5 million in reimbursement for legal costs and expenses incurred by the Nigerian authorities.  Nigeria agreed to dismiss all charges against Snamprogetti and to renounce to any civil claims and criminal charges in any jurisdiction.<br /><br />Kazakhstan<br /><br />The investigation is ongoing.<br /><br />African Development Bank<br /><br />On 2 June 2014, Snamprogetti agreed to pay the Africa Development Bank USD $5.7 million in penalties for bribery related to contracts for liquefied natural gas production plants on Bonny Island, Nigeria.   
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>The DOJ and SEC will pursue FCPA violations committed by U.S. and foreign companies alike.</li><li>Information obtained by the DOJ and SEC from one cooperating company will likely be utilized to investigate and prosecute other entities implicated in the same or related conduct.</li></ul>
