        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        EBRD<br /><br />According to Bloomberg News, on 13 April 2012, two individuals were charged with corruption and money laundering in London.  Andrey Ryjenko, a former employee of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("EBRD") and Tatjana Sanderson, a former employee of Standard Bank Plc, were charged with accepting bribes and laundering USD $3 million in exchange for favorable loan treatment  of Chestnut Consulting Inc., a Pennsylvania company, between September 2007 and March 2010.  <br /><br />According to a criminal indictment filed in a Philadelphia court, Dmitrij Harder, the former owner and CEO of Chestnut Consulting, bribed a senior official at the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("EBRD").  The indictment charged Mr. Harder with paying more than USD $3.5 million to the EBRD official.  The payments allegedly went via the official's sister under a phony contract she had with Chestnut Consulting.  According to the criminal indictment, in exchange for the bribes, the EBRD official influenced the approval of financing for two of Chestnut Consulting's corporate clients. One project involved an investment by the EBRD of USD $85 million and a €90 million ($107 million) loan.  The second project resulted in a USD $40 million investment and a USD $60 million convertible loan, the DOJ said. <br /><br />Chestnut Consulting allegedly earned about USD $8 million in “success fees” as a result of the EBRD’s approval of the two applications, the DOJ said.<br /><br />The case was scheduled for criminal trial in November 2012 in London, but the results were not published.  The company appears to be under investigation by U.S. authorities.
