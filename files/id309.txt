        Ingersoll-Rand plc ("Ingersoll-Rand")
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Global diversified industrial company

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Ingersoll-Rand described the ongoing investigation as follows in its SEC Form 10-K filed on 22 February 2011:<br /><br />"Additionally, the Company has reported to the DOJ and SEC certain matters which raise potential issues under the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, including matters which were reported during the past quarter. The Company has conducted, and continues to conduct, investigations and have had preliminary discussions with respect to these matters with the SEC and DOJ, which are ongoing. The SEC has indicated that it will seek additional information and documents regarding these matters. These matters (and others which may arise or of which we become aware in the future) may be deemed to violate the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Such determinations could subject the Company to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties (if, for example, the DOJ deems us to have violated the DPA), material fines, equitable remedies (including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect the Company's business prospects, financial position, or the market value of its stock."
