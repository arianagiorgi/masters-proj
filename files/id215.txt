        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports, the Prosecutor's Office attached to Romania's High Court of Cassation and Justice has been investigating whether criminal acts were committed in Romania in connection with breaches of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq.  Codrut Seres, the Minister of Economy and Commerce, announced that his Ministry would also look into whether state-owned companies participating in the Oil-for-Food programme had been involved in illegal payments made to the former Iraqi regime.<br /><br />One of the main issues in connection with the investigation is whether the Romanian companies involved were privately owned at the time of the alleged wrongdoing.  Romanian companies were among those named in the U.N. Independent Inquiry Report, including Rompetrol, Bulf Drilling and Oil Servicii.  <br /><br />According to press reports, the Romanian Intelligence Service ("SRI") claims that in 2003 the U.N. notified it that the Romanian Workers' Party was implicated as an intermediary in the Oil for Food scandal, the entity having acted as an intermediary for the purchase of oil for a Swiss company.
