        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        JGC Corporation was part of the four-company "TSKJ" joint venture [Technip of France; Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. (a subsidiary of Saipem SpA of Italy); KBR of the U.S.; and JGC of Japan] that was alleged to have paid hundreds of millions in bribes to Nigerian officials between 1995 and 2004 in order to secure four engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for the development of liquefied natural gas facilities on Bonny Island in Nigeria.  The joint venture operated in Nigeria through three Portuguese special purpose corporations.  The value of the contracts to TSKJ was over USD $6 billion.   JGC allegedly authorized the joint venture's hiring of two agents - Jeffrey Tesler and Japanese trading company Marubeni Corporation - through which improper payments were made to various Nigerian government officials, including top-level executive branch officials.  The joint venture paid over USD $180 million to these two agents during the course of the bribery scheme.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        According to press reports, the Nigeria LNG bribery scandal first came to light during the course of investigations by French prosecutors into Elf-Aquitaine's operations in Asia and Africa. 
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 31 January 2011, JGC released a "Notice of Loss and Revision of Earnings Forecasts for Fiscal Year Ending March 2011," stating that it had set aside JPY 17.8 billion (approx. USD $218.4 million) in anticipation of settlement with the DOJ.  The company also set aside JPY 2.3 billion (USD $28.2 million) for settlement with the Nigerian authorities.<br /><br />On 6 April 2011, the DOJ filed a two-count criminal information charging JGC with with one count of conspiracy and one count of aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA.  JGC entered into a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, agreeing to pay a USD $218.8 million criminal fine and to retain an independent compliance consultant for a two-year term. <br /><br />African Development Bank<br /><br />On 21 March 2014, the African Development Bank levied a USD $5.2 million fine against JGC for corrupt practices in connection to contracts for natural gas production plants on Bonny Island, Nigeria from 1995 until 2004.
