        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Press reports from June 2011 reveal that until February 2011, Goldman had been negotiating with Libya's sovereign investment fund, the Libyan Investment Authority ("LIA").  Earlier, LIA had given Goldman Sachs USD 1.3 billion to invest, but the investments lost 98% of their value.  In exchange for a waiver of liability claims, Goldman agreed to pay some of the costs plus USD 50 million to an outside consultant, Palladyne,  which was run by the son-in-law of the head of Libya's state-owned oil company. <br /><br />The Company's spokesman, Lucas van Praag, noted, "We are confident that nothing we did or proposed was or could have been a breach of any rule or regulation.  We retained outside counsel, as is our normal practice for any transaction, to ensure that we were compliant with all applicable rules."<br /><br />The Company's SEC filings state that it and "certain of its affiliates are subject to a number of investigations and reviews . . . including compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the effectiveness of insider trading controls and internal information barriers."
