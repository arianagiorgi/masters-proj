        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to the Wall Street Journal, a whistleblower delivered an email to DHL and the companies in the consortium in April 2012, alleging that the Tengizchevroil consortium had been making improper payments to Kazakh customs officials since 2004. The purpose of the payments was to allow shipments to pass through customs in spite of small paperwork errors; without the payments, the errors could have caused significant delays in the importation of necessary supplies by these companies.  The whistleblower also alleged that DHL regularly pays "convoy bribes" on behalf of Tengizchevroil, often amounting to bribes of USD 150 to USD 300 paid to customs officials and offficial escorts required by Kazakh law, to ensure that shipments would not be delayed. <br /><br />In May 2013, Tengizchevroil hired U.S. law firm King & Spalding LLP to conduct an internal investigation into allegations received from an anonymous tipster, according to  emails reviewed by Dow Jones. The whistleblower has threatened to disclose the alleged FCPA related violations to the U.S. Department of Justice.
