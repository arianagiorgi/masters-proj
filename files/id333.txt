        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Aftab Noor Al-Hassan, a British citizen from London, admitted to making over 13 illegal payments totaling over USD 1.6 million to the Iraqi Government from 2001 to 2002 in order to secure lucrative oil contracts under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme.  During this period, payments to Iraq could legally only be made after a license had been granted by Her Majesty's Treasury.  Al-Hassan had neither obtained nor sought any such license.<br /><br />In exchange for the illegal payments, Al-Hassan obtained contracts for 11 million barrels of oil valued at over USD 220 million. This oil was sold for a profit of over USD 4.4 million.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        After the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq, the United Nations set up a committee to investigate sanctions breaches. In the committee's findings published in October 2005, Al-Hassan was identified as one of the individuals involved in breaking sanctions.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        The SFO commenced an investigation which led to Al-Hassan's arrest in September 2008.  He was charged August 2009 and pleaded guilty to all charges on 13 January 2011.  On 25 January 2011, Al-Hassan was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment, suspended for two years.<br /><br />The UK made the breach of United Nation sanctions on Iraq a criminal offense by legislation implemented in 1990 and 2000.  Al-Hassan pleaded guilty to offenses under the legislation implemented in 2000 - i.e., The Iraq (United Nations Sanctions) Order 2000 (Statutory Instrument 3241) - which made it a criminal offense to make funds available to the Iraqi Government without a license granted by HM Treasury.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>The UK SFO has pursued both companies and individuals involved in breaches of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq in the early 2000s.</li></ul>
