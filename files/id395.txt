        <h1>SL INDUSTRIES, INC.</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        SL Industries, Inc.<br />SL Xianghe Power Electronics Corporation, wholly owned subsidiary incorporated and operating in China ("SL Xianghe")<br />SL Shanghai Power Electronics Corporation, wholly owned subsidiary incorporated and operating in China ("SL Shanghai Power")<br />SL Shanghai International Trading Corporation, wholly owned subsidiary incorporated and operating in China ("SL Shanghai Trading")
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Manufacture and sale of power electronics, motion control, power protection, electromagnetic and communication equipment used in medical, commercial and military aerospace, computer, datacom, industrial, telecom and transportation equipment
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        China<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        In its SEC Form 10-K filed on 30 March 2012, the Company stated it it was conducting an investigation of SL Xianghe, SL Shanghai Power, and SL Shanghai Trading, as they "may have improperly provided gifts and entertainment to government officials."  The statement continues, "on March 29, 2012, the Company's outside counsel contacted the DOJ and the SEC voluntarily to disclose that the Company was conducting an internal investigation, and agreed to cooperate fully and update the DOJ and SEC periodically on further developments."<br /><br />Thereafter, in the Company's quarterly report, SEC Form 10-Q filed on 10 May 2012, the ongoing investigation into whether employees of the three above-named "indirect wholly owned subsidiaries incorporated  and operating <br />exclusively in China, may have improperly provided gifts and entertainment to government officials," is called "the China investigation."  The Company notes that preliminary estimates of the amounts of the gifts and entertainment do not materially affect the Company's financial statements.  However, the Company also notes that since the investigation includes determining  whether there were any violations of laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, "on March 29, 2012, the Company's outside counsel contacted the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") voluntarily to disclose that the Company was conducting an internal investigation,  and agreed to cooperate fully and update the DOJ and SEC periodically on further developments.  Since then, the Company's counsel has done so, and the Company has continued to cooperate fully with the DOJ and the SEC."<br /><br />Describing its expenses, the Company added, "SLPE's expenses increased by $323,000 in 2012 primarily due to an increase in consulting and legal fees related to an on-going internal investigation to determine if some employees may have<br />improperly provided gifts and entertainment to government officials in China."<br />
