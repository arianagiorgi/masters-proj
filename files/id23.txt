        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        AGA Medical Corporation ("AGA")
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Sale of medical devices 
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>

        China<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) alleged that AGA violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA in connection with kickbacks paid to physicians in China between 1997 and 2005 and improper payments made to patent officials between 2000 and 2002.  <br /><br />Between 1997 and 2005, a high-ranking AGA officer and other AGA employees paid kickbacks to physicians employed at government-owned hospitals in China, directing the payments through AGA's Chinese distributor.  In exchange for the kickbacks, the physicians directed the hospitals to purchase AGA products over those of competitors.  AGA and its Chinese distributor often referred to the kickbacks as commissions, rewards or rebates owed to the physicians.<br /><br />In addition, from 2000 through 2002, AGA and a high-ranking AGA officer made improper payments, also through its Chinese distributor, to officials at the State Intellectual Property Office to secure the patent approval of AGA products.  The Chinese distributor would, at times, describe the payments as sponsoring the patent official.  <br /><br />AGA paid at least USD 460,000 in kickbacks to doctors in government-owned hospitals and patent-office officials.  For the period from 1997 to 2005, AGA earned USD 13.5 million in sales to government-owned hospitals in China.  <br /><br />On 3 June 2008, agreed to pay a USD $2 million criminal penalty in connection with corrupt payments to Chinese government officials in violation of the FCPA.

        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 2 June 2008, AGA entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement, admitting to violations of the FCPA and agreeing to pay a USD 2 million criminal penalty.  AGA also agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor for three years.
