        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        SITEL Corporation ("SITEL")

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        SITEL described the ongoing investigation as follows in a 2006 SEC Form 10-Q.  The company was acquired by ClientLogic in 2007 and taken private, after which there is no further public information regarding the status of the investigation.<br /><br />"On March 1, 2006, we contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement Division and reported that we had identified accounting and other irregularities in our Brazil subsidiary that raised the possibility of violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We completed an internal investigation into these irregularities, with the assistance of independent outside counsel in Brazil. The investigation did not reveal any prior involvement or knowledge regarding the irregularities by any officer or director of the Company. We have taken and are taking remedial actions. We restated our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2001 through 2004 and for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2005 as a result of errors in the prior financial statements identified as a result of the investigation. We reported to the SEC on the results of the internal investigation and are responding to the SECâ€™s requests for further information. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the ongoing discussions with the SEC. The outcome could include the institution of administrative or civil injunctive proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former Company employees, officers and/or directors, the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and/or sanctions and/or a referral to other governmental agencies."
