        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to a Reuters article from 16 September 2011, the Cuban police shut down Tri-Star Caribbean's offices in Havana in July 2011 and arrested CEO Sarkis Yacoubian amid allegations of corrupt import-export practices. A Miami Herald story from 23 May 2013 reported that Yacoubian's trial had begun and that he was indicted in April 2013 "on charges of bribery, tax evasion and 'activities damaging to the economy.'" According to the story in the Miami Herald, Yacoubian said during a phone interview that "he had no choice but to pay island officials to secure business contracts, and claimed to have blown the whistle on corruption involving Tri-Star and other companies." The story described other allegations by the prosecution: "Yacoubian or his employees bribed at least a dozen state officials with everything from nice dinners and prepaid phone cards to cash â€” $300 for a tip on a deal, $50,000 for a 2008 contract on earth movers."<br /><br />Reuters reported on 23 May 2013 that Yacoubian had confessed in a 2012 video to "passing packets of money to Cuban officials visiting Canada when he worked for the Tokmakjian Group, then continuing the same practice after he founded Tri-Star Caribbean." According to Reuters, Yacoubian's associate Krikor Bayassalian is a co-defendant in the proceedings.
