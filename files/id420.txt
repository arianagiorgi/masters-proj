        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Kazakhstan<br /><br />ExxonMobil, along with Chevron and KMG, formed the Tengizchevroil consortium to develop the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields.  A whistleblower sent an email in April 2012 alleging improper payments to Kazakh customs officials.  The email alleged that the members of the consortium had used DHL since 2004 to make improper payments to Kazakh customs authorities, in order to allow shipments to pass through customs in spite of small paperwork errors; without the payments, the errors could have caused significant delays in the importation of necessary supplies by these companies.  The whistleblower also alleged that USD 150-300 payments had been made to officials to allow convoys to be  escorted as required by Kazakh law, and to move through customs without delay. As of October 2013, ExxonMobil continues to be under investigation by the Department of Justice for alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.<br /><br />These are not the first allegations of misconduct by ExxonMobil in Kazakhstan.  In 2001, investigations preceding the merger of the large oil companies revealed that Mobil Corp, Amoco Corp, and Phillips Petroleum Kazakhstan Ltd,  paid hundreds of millions of dollars for oil rights during the 1990s, with large sums of money ending up in bank accounts controlled by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, oil minister Nurlan Balgimbayev, treasury director Saouat Mynbaev, and other senior officials.  The funds are reported to have been paid first into Swiss bank accounts, and later transferred to offshore accounts in the British Virgin Islands.
