        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        [Abbot, which trades under the name KCA Deutag, is owned by private equity investors.  It manages, operates, services or owns over 100 drilling facilities in 22 countries, and employs 8000 individuals worldwide.]  <br /><br />Following the discovery of improper payments during a routine tax audit initiated by an unidentified foreign tax authority in 2011, Abbot  engaged outside counsel and accountants, who reviewed 100 contracts covering more than a decade.  The Company's representatives interviewed 30 people and reviewed over one million email communications.  They found that a contract entered into in 2006 resulted in improper payments to a foreign company in 2007.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Abbot discovered improper payments during a routine tax audit conducted by foreign authorities in 2011.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 23 November 2012, Abbot agreed to a civil settlement of GBP 5.6 million (USD 8.9 million), which represents the profit obtained from a 2006 contract between an overseas unit of Abbot and an oil and gas company.  The settlement, similar to a Non Prosecution Agreement, is allowed under Scottish law under certain circumstances, which include voluntary disclosure, and the action taken by the company following discovery of the improper payments.  In Abbot's case, the personnel involved left the company, and Abbot undertook a thorough independent investigation.<br /><br />The penalty will be paid in three installments to the "CashBack for Communities Programme" established by the Scottish government. The program takes money from the Proceeds of Crime Act and invests it in sporting, cultural, community mentoring projects and sports facilities for the benefit of Scottish youth and communities. <br /> <br />The Company stated that it could not disclose details about the persons or the jurisdiction involved, pending a possible criminal investigation of those individuals.<br /><br />In a 25 November 2012 press statement, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service listed the criteria taken into consideration in deciding to refer the case to the Civil Recovery Unit for extra-judicial settlement, in accordance with the published guidance on self-reporting:  noted that In accordance with the published guidance on self-reporting, the following criteria were considered in the decision to refer this case to the Civil Recovery Unit for an extra-judicial settlement:  "the nature and seriousness of the offence and the extent of the harm caused;  the extent of the wrongdoing within the business, including whether the conduct was authorised by, or connived in, by senior management, or restricted to a small number of lower-ranking individuals; whether it is clear that the business is taking action as soon as the matter comes to the attention of senior management (as opposed to taking no action until it becomes aware that there is a risk that the conduct is going to come to light whether the business (or the individuals involved in the matter reported) has any previous record for this type of conduct. This would go beyond a previous criminal conviction, and would include any regulatory enforcement action or warning; whether the individuals involved in the wrongdoing have left the business and, where decisions were taken at Board level, whether there is a new Board in place, and in both cases the timing and reasons for the departure of these individuals; whether the business has honoured its commitment to engage with the Crown meaningfully and in particular to disclose the full extent of the wrongdoing; whether the business had in place adequate anti-bribery systems at the time of the criminal conduct and whether it has further addressed this following the conduct; whether there are particular considerations which may weigh against prosecution, such as the consequences of prosecution for the company's employees and stakeholders."<br /><br />Abbot is the first Scottish company, and one of the first companies altogether, to enter into a civil settlement under the 2011 self-reporting program introduced when the Bribery Act came into effect.
