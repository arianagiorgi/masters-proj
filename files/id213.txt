They did so in order to circumvent local rules and regulations relating to the import of goods and materials into numerous foreign jurisdictions. Panalpina admitted that between 2002 and 2007, it paid thousands of bribes totaling at least $27 million to foreign officials in at least seven countries, including Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Russia and Turkmenistan."

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Panalpina described the (at the time, ongoing) investigation as follows in its 2009 Annual Report:<br /><br />"Investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) were largely completed during the year under review. Panalpina is now taking part in settlement negotiations with the DOJ. <br /><br />As reported earlier, Panalpina is a party to a multinational probe into alleged anticompetitive behavior conducted by several competition authorities, including the European Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Swiss Competition Commission, against a number of major freight forwarding companies. The investigations commenced in October 2007. In Canada and Australia respective investigations have been closed in the meantime due to a lack of evidence. In February 2010, Panalpina was served with a Statement of Objections by the European Commission. This document contains the European Commission’s preliminary view with respect to alleged anticompetitive behaviour in the freight forwarding industry. Panalpina will closely examine the Commission’s preliminary findings and will respond in due time. The Statement of Objections enables the addressees to respond to the Commission’s preliminary findings and does not prejudge the final decision of the European Commission which is subject to appeal to the European courts. <br /><br />It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings at this stage. They may, however, result in material penalties being imposed on Panalpina entities. <br /><br />Panalpina has also intensified its cooperation with the U.S. DOJ (Antitrust Division), with the aim of reaching a settlement in the first half of 2010. It is not yet possible to predict how long proceedings of other compliance authorities will take.<br /><br />Legal and consultancy costs, incurred mainly in connection with the DOJ investigations into alleged violations of the FCPA, came to CHF 55 million in total during the year under review, which is higher than originally expected."
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On November 4, 2010, the DOJ filed a criminal information charging Panalpina with conspiracy to violate and violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.  Panalpina and the DOJ entered into a deferred prosecution agreement.<br /><br />On the same day, the DOJ filed a criminal information charging Panalpina, Inc. with conspiring to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA and with aiding and abetting certain customers in violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA.  Panalpina, Inc. agreed to plead guilty to the charges.<br /><br />The deferred prosecution agreement and plea agreement impose a USD 70.56 million criminal penalty.  <br /><br />Also on November 4, 2010, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Panalpina, Inc. consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement and permanently enjoining the company from violating the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions and aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions.  Panalpina, Inc. agreed to pay USD 11,329,369 in disgorgement of profits and prejudgment interest.  <br /><br />According to press reports in November 2010, Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is pursuing a domestic bribery action against Panalpina.  The EFCC reportedly raided Panalpina's Lagos office on November 26th and arrested 11 of its top officials.  
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>The DOJ and SEC will pursue investigations against entities serving as intermediaries or middlemen through whom improper payments are made to foreign officials on behalf of a client or for a client's benefit.</li></ul>
