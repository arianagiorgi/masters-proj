        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Nanyozai Freight Agreement Cartel (a cartel of Japanese shipping companies) ("NFA")

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        News agencies reported that, since 1981, nine NFA members shipped lumber from Malaysia to Japan through Dewaniaga Sarawak ("DNS"), which is a government-affiliated company that exclusively controls exportation of lumber in Sarawak State, one of the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo.  The shipments were made pursuant to an agreement between NFA and DNS.  <br /><br />DNS's President is the brother of Abdul Taib Mahmud, Prime Minister of Sarawak State and DNS ordered the nine NFA members to appoint a company in Hong Kong, Region Star ("RS"), as a broker.  RS was reportedly deeply connected to not only DNS but also to Abdul Taib Mahmud.  <br /><br />Until 2005, the nine NFA members made payments to RS of at least JPY 2,500,000,000 (US$22,500,000) in the form of brokerage commissions.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        In March 2007, news agencies reported that the TRTB pointed out that, in relation to the payments to RS, the nine NFA members failed to declare in total JPY 1,100,000,000 (US$9,900,000) in corporate income over the previous seven-year period.  
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        News agencies reported that the TRTB's position was that the payments to RS as brokerage commissions were not allowable expenses.  The TRTB reportedly made a reassessment and subsequent collection order against the nine NFA members.
