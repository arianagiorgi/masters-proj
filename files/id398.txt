        <h1>DELTA TUCKER HOLDINGS, INC.</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. ("Delta Tucker")<br />DynCorp International Inc. ("DynCorp," a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Tucker)<br />Al Ghabban (a subcontractor performing trucking services)<br />
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Support services for military installations and operations
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Falls Church, Virginia, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Unspecified<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        On 28 November 2009, Reuters reported that DynCorp, which was later acquired by Delta Tucker, had discovered approximately USD 300,000 in payments "made to expedite the issuance of a limited number of visas and licenses from foreign government agencies. . . ." As reported in Delta Tucker's SEC Form 10-K filed on 9 April 2012, facts relating to these payments were voluntarily disclosed to the DOJ and the SEC in November 2009. In its Form 10-K submitted to the SEC on 27 March 2013, Delta Tucker said that the DOJ had notified the Company on 5 February 2013 that it was closing its investigation without taking any action. The Form 10-K mentioned nothing, however, about the SEC's investigation.<br /><br />In its 9 April 2012 Form 10-K, Delta Tucker also reported that it was served with a DOJ subpoena in August 2005 "seeking documents concerning work performed by a former subcontractor, Al Ghabban," who performed line-hauling services in the Middle East between 2002 and 2005.  The Company received a follow-up telephone call in April 2009, continued to have discussions with the DOJ about it and has provided information to the DOJ on the subject. The Company "believe[s] that the likelihood of an unfavorable judgment resulting from this matter is reasonably possible."

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Unknown
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        Regarding the alleged payments to expedite licenses and visas, the DOJ notified the Company on 5 February 2013 that "their inquiry regarding this matter has been closed based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the voluntary disclosure by the company, the thorough investigation undertaken by the company, and the steps taken to enhance the company's anti-corruption compliance program." The SEC's investigation of these allegations appears to be ongoing.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>An FCPA investigation by the DOJ does not always result in an enforcement action or penalty against a company.</li><li>Effective internal investigations and enhancements of anti-corruption compliance program can be persuasive factors in the DOJ's decision to close an investigation without taking a formal enforcement action.</li></ul>
