        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The allegations described below may involve conduct in Italy, India, Brazil and Panama.<br /><br />In 2011 Finmeccanica faced accusations that it had created slush funds to use to bribe politicians. Finmeccanica's chairman, Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, came under investigation, and resigned in December 2011.  <br /><br />Rumors again emerged in February and March 2012, all of which were denied by Finmeccanica and the Italian authorities. Then, in April 2012, various media sources reported that India's Minister of Defence AK Antony had requested information from the Italian authorities regarding allegations that Finmeccanica used money from an Indian helicopter sale to pay political bribes in Italy.  Antony confirmed this in a statement on 26 November 2012, and noted that he had not commenced a formal investigation.<br /><br />Allegations relate to the sale of 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters to India in 2010.  Media reports also allege that Claudio Scajola, a minister in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, is being investigated for his dealings with former Finmeccanica executive Paolo Pozzessere regarding commissions.<br /><br />On 17 April 2012, a businessman named Valter Lavitola turned himself in to police in Rome; a warrant had been issued for his arrest six months earlier, but he had remained abroad.  Lavitola stands accused of fraud, money laundering, and offering bribes to the president of Panama for construction contracts on behalf of Finmeccanica.  Lavitola was at one time closely associated with Silvio Berlusconi, former prime minister of Italy, who headed the Lega Nord party.  Media reports claim that Lega Nord has been the recipient of the slush fund money generated by the Indian helicopter sales.<br /><br />On 5 June 2012, it was announced that Italian prosecutors were investigating allegations that Finmeccanica officials created a slush fund to channel money to political parties.  The Company's former chairman, Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, is under investigation for making false invoices and tax fraud, while his wife Marina Grossi, the CEO of Finmeccanica subsidiary SELEX, is under investigation for creating false invoices and for corrupt practices.  SELEX is thought to have created false invoices to avoid paying taxes, and to have used the extra cash to establish a USD 2.7 million fund for intermediaries to pay politicians.  The contracts used to generate the funds may have been with the Air Traffic Controllers' organization, ENAV. <br /><br />Also on 5 June 2012, public prosecutors in Naples conducted a search of offices and dwellings belonging to the former Vatican bank head, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, based on allegations of international corruption and bribes paid in order to obtain contracts for the Finmeccanica group in Europe and South America. <br /><br />On 12 February 2013, the New York Times reported that Giuseppe Orsi was arrested in Milan in relation to the bribery allegations surrounding AgustaWestland's sale of 12 helicopters to India in 2010. The article also said that authorities are looking for two residents of Switzerland who may have acted as intermediaries in the alleged bribes. Reuters reported on 12 February 2013 that the arrest warrant alleged that Mr. Orsi and others used intermediaries to bribe a former chief of the Indian Air Force so that he would change the terms of the helicopter contract tender in order to help AgustaWestland win the contract. The Financial Times reported on 13 February 2013 that this former chief is Shashi Tyagi, who denies the allegations. <br /><br />Reuters reported on 15 February 2013 that Mr. Orsi has resigned from his position as chairman and as a Fenmeccanica board member. Reuters also reported that Finmeccanica appointed a new CEO on 13 February 2013 to replace Mr. Orsi.<br /><br />On 2 April 2013, Reuters reported that Italian investigators uncovered allegations of bribery surrounding AgustaWestland and a tender for 197 light reconnaissance helicopters in India. The allegations are that an Indian army brigadier requested USD 5 million in exchange for helping AgustaWestland win the tender. The Indian government has delayed a final decision on the tender due to the allegations, and AgustaWestland did not succeed in making the short list for the tender. The article stated that it is unknown whether any bribes were paid.<br /><br />In October 2013,  India suspended the contract to supply 12 luxury VIP choppers after Italian investigators began looking into allegations that AgustaWestland paid bribes to win the contract.  India issued a "final show cause notice" to AgustaWestland, demanding reasons that action should not be taken against it for violating the terms of the integrity pact that must be signed by defense suppliers.  On 20 November 2013, AgustaWestland met with Indian defense officials following the move to cancel its EU 556 million (approximately USD $753 million) deal to supply helicopters following corruption charges.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        According the Reuters' 2 April 2013 article, the allegations regarding the tender for 197 helicopters were discovered by Italian prosecutors who were investigating the AgustaWestland 12-helicopter contract with the Indian Air Force.  <br /><br />The sources of the other allegations are unknown.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        Italy<br /><br />Public Prosecutor of Naples<br /><br />Finmeccanica's Half-year Financial Report ("Half-year Report"), which was published on 31 July 2012, reported that Finmeccanica complied with a court order on 28 June 2012 to produce evidence regarding the AgustaWestland helicopter contract with India.  Finmeccanica had previously provided documentation in April and May, including documents regarding the Company's relationship with foreign suppliers and intermediaries.  <br /><br />According to the Half-year Report, on 3 July 2012, the Public Prosecutor of Naples' office issued a search warrant for the offices of the chairman of FATA SpA, in connection with a criminal investigation about the chairman's relationship with "certain third parties."  <br /><br />Earlier orders for production of documents focus on contracts entered into in 2010 between Finmeccanica and/or its group companies (AgustaWestland, SELEX Sistemi Integrati, and Telespazio Argentina) and the government of Panama. <br /><br />Likewise, earlier requests were made for documents involving relations with a consultancy company called VL Consulting, and a promoter called Agafia Corp. Prosecutors also investigated promotional expenses connected with Alenia Aeronautica and AnsaldoBreda, and the supply by Ansaldo of trains for the underground metrorail system in Fortaleza, Brazil.  <br /><br />Reuters reported on 23 October 2012 that Paolo Pozzessere, a former business manager at Finmeccanica (he resigned from his position when allegations first emerged) and current adviser to Finmeccanica, was arrested in Milan in connection with corruption allegations regarding the Company's contracts in Brazil and Panama.  On the same day, police searched offices in both Naples and Rome. Reuters also reported that former Minister of Industry (under Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) Claudio Scajola, is under investigation.<br /><br />On 24 March 2014, two former managers of Finmeccanica, Mr. Borgogni and Mr. Carlini, were placed under house arrest over allegations of international corruption connected to a tracking system for waste-hauling trucks.<br /><br />Public Prosecutor of Milan<br /><br />According to the Half-year Report, Ansaldo Energia SpA filed an appeal against a decision issued by the Milan Court on 20 September 2011 ordering the Company to pay an administrative fine of EUR 150,000.  A hearing is scheduled for 20 September 2012.  (Ansaldo Energia is 100% owned by Ansaldo Energia Holding, which in turn is 54.55% owned by Finmeccanica.)  The fine was imposed for bribery in the award of tenders.<br /><br />Reuters reported that the Public Prosecutor of Milan arrested Giuseppe Orsi, CEO and chairman of Finmeccanica, on 12 February 2013. Reuters also reported that three other people, including AgustaWestland CEO Bruno Spagnolini, were put under house arrest. The Wall Street Journal reported that Orsi's trial in Milan began on 19 June 2013.<br /><br />On 16 July 2014, an Italian judge issued arrest warrants for Christian Michell, a consultant based in Dubai, and Giuseppe Orsi, former chairman and CEO.  The judge declared the two fugitives and said the paperwork had been sent to their lawyers.<br /><br />Public Prosecutor of Rome<br /><br />According to the Half-year Report, in conjunction with the proceeding initiated against SELEX Sistemi Integrati, the prosecutor's office filed an attachment order against Electron Italia on 17 January 2012.  The order required the production of all agreements signed in 2009 between SELEX and Soluzioni di Business, a consulting company.  Electron Italia paid Soluzioni a flat sum of EUR 10,000 as "the contractually agreed amount . . . by way of a lump-sum reimbursement of expenses."  <br /><br />The Director of External Relations of SELEX was investigated; his employment was terminated on 7 December 2011.  The former chairman of Finmeccanica was also under investigation, and resigned on 1 December 2011.  The CEO of SELEX was investigated for bribery offenses, and tendered his resignation on 14 December 2011.  The Sales Manager of SELEX, also investigated for bribery, resigned on 13 December 2011. In an investigation into allegations of bribery in the assignment of projects by ENAV, the prosecutor's office issued a search warrant on 18 January 2012 to obtain contracts signed with Print Sistem and Electron Italia in 2009.  Additional warrants were issued on 8 March 2012 for 2009 contracts with ENAV.  On 23 April 2012, SELEX Sistemi Integrati was notified by the prosecutor's office of these document seizures. <br /><br />According to the Half-year Report, in February 2012, SELEX hired an expert, RINA Services, to investigate fairness in the allocation of contracts to Arc Trade, Print Sistem, Techno Sky, and Renco between January 2008 and November 2011.  Of the analyzed orders, orders or portions of orders totaling EUR 32 million (or 23% of the total) were found incongruent, whereas another portion of orders approximating EUR 16 million could not be analyzed because they are fixed-price orders. SELEX elected to proceed to an on-site analysis by RINA in October 2012.<br /><br />According to the Half-year Report, SELEX Sistemi Integrati commenced disciplinary proceedings in March 2012 against five employees, three of whom were terminated based on their conduct regarding the ENAV contracts.  <br /><br />(Electron Italia is 80% owned by SELEX Elsag SpA.  Digint Srl was at one time 49% owned by Finmeccanica Group Service, in turn wholly owned by Finmeccanica, and now renamed SELEX Elsag Cyberlabs, which is 49% owned by SELEX Elsag.)<br /><br />Public Prosecutor of L'Aquila <br /><br />According to the Half-year Report, criminal proceedings were initiated by the Aquila public prosecutor concerning orders placed between SELEX Service Management and Abruzzo Engineering (30% owned by SELEX).  This led to a bribery investigation of SELEX's operations manager, which is still pending.<br /><br />India<br /><br />On 12 February 2013, the New York Times reported that the Indian Defence Ministry had been seeking information from the governments of Italy and the United Kingdom. Unable to gather enough information to support the allegations, the Defence Ministry referred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation ("CBI"). The Financial Times reported on 13 February 2013 that the CBI has initiated a probe into the allegations.<br /><br />BBC News reported on 13 March 2013 that the CBI has registered a criminal case against Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland and SP Tyagi, among others. The BBC News article said that the CBI conducted a number of raids (including a raid of Mr. Tyagi's home) on 13 March 2013 in its investigation of four companies and twelve individuals.<br /><br />In December 2013, India's Defense Ministry canceled the EU 556 million contract for twelve helicopters.<br /><br />On 26 August 2014, India banned Finmeccanica from future contracts, as the investigation into the canceled helicopter contract continues.  According to a report by Reuters, an anonymous source within the Defense Ministry said, "Where a tender process is yet to commence, a company under the Finmeccanica group of companies should not be given tender papers for purposes of bidding."<br /><br />On 17 September 2014, India announced that it was lifting the ban against Finmeccanica, and will allow the company to bid on its tenders.<br /><br />
