        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        ENSCO International plc ("ENSCO")<br />

        Offshore drilling contractor

        Portlethen, Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        ENSCO described the ongoing investigation as follows in its Form 10-K filed with the  U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission ("SEC") on 24 February 2011:<br /><br />"As is customary for companies operating offshore Nigeria, we had engaged independent customs brokers to process customs clearance of routine shipments of equipment, materials and supplies and to process the ENSCO 100 temporary importation permits, extensions and renewals. One or more of the customs brokers that our subsidiary in Nigeria used to obtain the ENSCO 100 temporary import permits, extensions and renewals also provided this service to other offshore service companies that have undertaken Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA') compliance internal investigations. <br /><br />"The principal purpose of our investigation was to determine whether any of the payments made to or by our customs brokers were inappropriate under the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA or whether any violations of the recordkeeping or internal accounting control provisions of the FCPA occurred. . . .<br /><br />"Following notification to the Audit Committee and to KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, in consultation with the Audit Committee's external legal counsel, we voluntarily notified the United States Department of Justice and the SEC that we had commenced an internal investigation. We expressed our intention to cooperate with both agencies, comply with their directives and fully disclose the results of the investigation."

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        ENSCO described the source of the investigation as follows in its SEC Form 10-K filed on 24 February 2011:<br /><br />"Following disclosures by other offshore service companies announcing internal investigations involving the legality of amounts paid to and by customs brokers in connection with temporary importation of rigs and vessels into Nigeria, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and management commenced an internal investigation in July 2007. The investigation initially focused on our payments to customs brokers relating to the temporary importation of ENSCO 100, our only rig that operated offshore Nigeria during the pertinent period."
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        As reported in ENSCO's SEC Form 10-K filed on 24 February 2012, both the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") have notified the Company that they do not intend to take any enforcement action against it with regards to the subject of the Company's internal investigation. The SEC's notice came in May 2010, and the DOJ's notice came in May 2011.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>An investigation by the SEC or DOJ does not necessarily result in an enforcement action against a company.</li></ul>
