        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Media sources reported in July 2010, that the EBRD had initiated an internal investigation into possible corruption in the grant of loans for commercial development projects.  In December 2010 the results of the investigation were given to the Russian government.<br /><br />In January 2011, the EBRD lifted the immunity of four of its former officials, including the former executive director, Yelena Kotova, in order to enable authorities in Moscow and London to investigate allegations of corruption in connection with the bank's loans in various republics of the former Soviet Union.  Kotova had been dismissed from her position at the EBRD one month earlier, in December 2010, immediately following disclosure of the investigation report, having served on the board of the EBRD since 2005.<br /> <br />On 15 January 2013, media sources reported that Kotova had been charged with bribery by the Russian authorities; specifically, she and Igor Lebedev were accused of demanding USD 1.4 million from a Canadian oil and gas exploration and development company in exchange for approval of a USD 95 million loan for the company.  <br /><br />Media sources also allege that two individuals have been charged with corruption and money laundering in London, Andrey Ryjenko and Tatjana Sanderson, and that their trial was scheduled to begin on 8 April 2013. Ryjenko was charged with accepting bribes and laundering USD 3 million in exchange for favorable loan treatment by the EBRD of Chestnut Consulting Inc., a Pennsylvania company, between September 2007 and March 2010.
