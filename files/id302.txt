        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports, on or around September 16, 2010, Nike China's Marketing Director, Li Tong, was arrested in connection with an investigation into alleged bribery and gambling involving the Chinese Football Association ("CFA"), with which Nike had won a sponsorship deal in 2009.  Li reportedly had a close relationship with the former head of the CFA, Nan Yong.<br /><br />Last year, Nike reportedly signed a USD 15 million deal to sponsor the CFA's Super League (China's national football league), an agreement that apparently can be extended for 10 years and augmented to eventually total 200 million dollars.  It is suspected that Li made improper payments to Nan in order to secure the sponsorship deal at a lower price than comparable sponsorships secured by competitors. <br /><br />Former CFA chief Nan, his deputy Yang Yimin and another senior aide were arrested earlier in 2010 on bribe-taking and match-fixing charges.  Other officials and referees have been detained as well.<br /><br />It is not clear at this time whether Nike itself is a target of the investigation.
