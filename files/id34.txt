        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Sometime in 1995, Thomas Qualey, President of IMS, met with a Lieutenant Colonel in the Brazilian Air Force who was stationed as a Foreign Liaison Officer at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.   The Lt. Col. was authorized to make purchases of military equipment on behalf of the purchasing agent of the Brazilian Air Force, the Brazilian Aeronautical Commission ("BAC").  Sometime in 1995, the Lt. Col. and Thomas Qualey agreed that IMS would purchase fork lift trucks, recondition them and then resell them to the BAC.   The Lt. Col. would approve the BAC's purchases in exchange for payments from IMS.  <br /><br />Between 1995 and 1996, Thomas Qualey arranged two purchases of fork lifts for repair and resale.  After each purchase, the Lt. Col. was paid by IMS for his approval of the transaction.  IMS paid the Lt. Col. USD 42,950 for the first transaction, and received USD 229,000 in revenue from the BAC.  IMS paid the Lt. Col. USD 24,613 for the second transaction, and received USD 163,250 in revenue.  IMS falsely described the payments to the Lt. Col. as sales commissions.
