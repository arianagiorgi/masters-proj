        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        AGEF GmbH (Berlin-based "Association of Experts in the Fields of Migration and Development Cooperation") ("AGEF")

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        German development agency AGEF is reportedly under investigation by the Berlin Public Prosecutor's Office, as well as Afghan authorities, for possible bribery in connection with the agency's repatriation project for Afghan refugees.  AGEF received about USD 8.8 million from ministries of the German government in 2010.  In November of that year, when media reports in Germany claimed that the agency had embezzled repatriation subsidies in Afghanistan, the Minister of Development sent inspectors to audit the agency's documents.  But many documents were missing, the audit was slow, and the government was criticized for poor oversight.  Earlier, in 2009, the Swedish and Danish development ministries had ceased working with AGEF, after finding unacceptable bookkeeping methods by AGEF in Iraq in late 2008.  The investigations began on 20 October 2011 and appears to be ongoing.

        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        The investigation is ongoing.
