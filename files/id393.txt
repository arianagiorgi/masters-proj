        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The Company's Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on 6 March 2012, contained the following statement: <br /><br />"During October 2011, the Company began an internal investigation into matters relating to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Company's internal policies in connection with services provided by a foreign entity affiliated with a Linc joint venture partner. Such services commenced prior to the Company's acquisition of Linc. As a result of the investigation, the Company has caused Linc to terminate its association with the arrangement. In December 2011, the Company contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to voluntarily disclose the results of its internal investigation to date. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential liability, if any, related to these matters. However, based on the facts currently known, the Company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There have been no significant changes to this contingency during the quarter ended January 31, 2012."<br /><br />This statement is repeated in the Company's  SEC Form 10-Q filed on 6 September 2012, in which the Company attributes USD 3.322 million to the internal investigation in the nine months period ending July 2012.
