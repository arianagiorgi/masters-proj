        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        In late 2007, AMEC identified certain irregular receipts received between November 2005 and early 2007, amounting to some USD $9 million. <br /><br />AMEC promptly appointed external advisors to carry out an investigation and self-reported the findings to the appropriate authorities, which included the SFO, in March 2008. 
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        The SFO investigation, which commenced on the receipt of a report from AMEC, determined that no criminal proceedings should be commenced against AMEC or any of its associated companies.  The SFO concluded that AMEC had failed to keep accurate records as required by law and this was a matter that could be dealt with by way of civil restitution as opposed to the use of criminal law.<br /><br />In October 2009, in a Consent Order agreed before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, AMEC agreed to a settlement payment of GBP 4,943,648 plus costs incurred as a result of the Civil Recovery Proceedings.<br /><br />Following detection of the irregularities, AMEC has worked to improve its ethics, compliance and accounting standards.  As part of the settlement, AMEC agreed to appoint an independent consultant to review these improvements and to report the findings to the SFO.<br /><br />The SFO acknowledged that, upon completion of the internal investigation, AMEC acted promptly and responsibly in referring the case, and cooperated with the SFO's investigation.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>In appropriate cases, the SFO will deal with issues relating to a business by way of civil settlement, as opposed to using criminal law, provided the matter is reported promptly and the business cooperates with the SFO.  Details as to the cases the SFO will determine are appropriate to be dealt with by way of civil settlement are contained in the SFO publication "Approach of the Serious Fraud Office for Dealing with Overseas Corruption."</li></ul>
