        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports on June 9, 2011, a Cuban court has convicted two Chilean businessmen for bribery of Cuban government officials.  Multiple Cuban officials - including the former Food Minister and Food Vice Minister - were convicted of receiving bribes.   The businessmen allegedly gave cash bribes and gifts to the officials in order to secure permission to divert products and raw materials, along with other unspecified fraudulent activities.  <br /><br />The case reportedly involved the activities of Rio Zaza, a juice company run by a holding company controlled by the Chilean businessman, Max Marambio.  Marambio was convicted in absentia in May and sentenced to 20 years and 15 years in prison, respectively.  His brother, Marcel Marambia, was convicted in absentia in June and sentenced for 15 years imprisonment in connection with the activities of his travel company, Sol y Son.   <br /><br />Details of the cases were not announced by the Cuban government.  Fifteen Cuban nationals were previously convicted in the case and given sentences between three and 10 years.<br /><br />The Chilean general manager of Rio Zaza was reportedly found dead in his apartment on April 13, 2010, in Havana.  Rio Zaza has had a virtual monopoly on selling packaged fruit juices within Cuba for nearly two decades.
