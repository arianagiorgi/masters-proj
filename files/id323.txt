        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Millipore reported the following in its SEC Form 10-Q filed on 12 August 2009:<br /><br />"Following our decision to consolidate the results of our 40 percent owned Indian Joint-Venture (the 'India JV') in January 2006, we learned as a result of our internal control procedures that certain payment and commission practices at the India JV raise issues of compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Promptly upon learning of this, our Audit and Finance Committee engaged outside counsel and commenced an investigation. We have implemented certain corrective actions. We notified the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice of this matter. The SEC undertook an investigation into the matter. By its letter on May 14, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission notified us that its investigation has been completed and it will not pursue any enforcement action on this matter. The operations and financial results of the India JV are not currently, and have not to date been, material to us."
