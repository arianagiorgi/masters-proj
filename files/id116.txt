        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Between 1997 and 2000 Ramendra Basu and Gautum Sengupta allegedly conspired with two Swedish consultants to award World Bank contracts in Kenya and Ethiopia to various Swedish companies in exchange for kickback payments totaling around USD 127,000.  In addition, they allegedly assisted the Swedish consultants with bribing a Kenyan official by wiring USD 50,000 into an account outside of the United States for the official's benefit. <br /><br />In September 1997, Basu left his job at the World Bank and began working for a Swedish consulting firm.  Basu was paid a 10% commission on the value of the contracts that he worked on.  In December 1997, Basu returned to the World Bank while continuing to receive "commissions" from the consulting firm.  Sengupta, Basu's co-conspirator, awarded three contracts to the consulting firm by January 1990.
