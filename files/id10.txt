        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Control Systems Specialist, Inc. ("CSS")<br />Darrold Richard Crites (President of CSS) <br />
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Purchase, repair, and resale of surplus military equipment 
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Fairborn, Ohio, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Brazil<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ charged CSS and Crites with conspiracy to violate the FCPA, substantive violations of the FCPA, and bribery of a U.S. public official in connection with improper payments made to a Lieutenant Colonel in the Brazilian Air Force (the BAF Lt. Col.) between 1995-1996 in order to secure sales of surplus military equipment to the Brazilian Aeronautical Commission ("BAC").  According to the Criminal Information, CSS and Crites made the agreement with the BAF Lt. Col. with the assistance of a U.S. Air Force civilian employee serving as the Command Country Manager for Brazil at the Wright Patterson Air Force in Ohio (the Country Manager).  <br /><br />Under the arrangement, the Country Manager provided Crites with surplus part numbers, model numbers, and U.S. military sources of surplus parts, in exchange for payments of money.  Crites then purchased the surplus equipment identified by the Country Manager, reconditioned it, and resold the same to the BAC.  The BAF Lt. Col. approved the purchases from CSS in exchange for payments of money.  Later, Crites and the Country Manager prepared and submitted bids to the BAC through the BAF Lt. Col., which involved additional improper payments.  Crites subsequently paid the BAF Lt. Col. a series of improper payments, disguised as consultant fees, for each bid accepted.<br /><br />Crites, through CSS and another company listed the Criminal Information as Company Y, arranged at least 44 purchases of surplus U.S. military equipment for repair and resale to the BAC.  Following each purchase, the BAF Lt. Col. was paid for his approval of the transaction.  Between 1994 and 1996, CSS, Crites and other unnamed individuals paid a total of USD 99,000 to the Country Manager and a total of USD 257,139 to the BAF Lt. Col.

        In 1998, CSS and Crites each pleaded guilty to a three-count information containing charges of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, substantive violations of the FCPA, and bribery of a U.S. public official.  Crites was sentenced to three years of probation and 150 hours of community service.  CSS was sentenced to a fine of USD 1,500 and one year of probation.
