        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        In October 1990, the United States indicted Harris Corporation, Schultz and Iacobucci for conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  The indictment alleged that the two individual defendants working for DTS conspired to pay commissions to O'Hara and his company, Polo, knowingly and with the intention that a portion of the commission payments be paid to foreign officials in Colombia.  Specifically, the indictment alleged that payments were made to a member of the Colombian CÃ¡mara de Representates ("CDR") in order that telecommunications contracts be awarded to Harris in Columbia.  In addition, payments are alleged to have been made to a company owned by a member of the CDR.   In one instance, it is alleged that a payment of  USD 22,845 was made to Polo with the intention that a portion would be paid to officials.  In another instance, it is alleged that bribe payments were explicitly discussed among the defendants in New York, and Iacobucci declared that he would not travel to Colombia without USD 5,500 in cash.  On a number of occasions, USD 3,000 were requested for "incidental fees" which the indictment alleges were for the purpose of bribes.
