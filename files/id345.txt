        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The company discovered the bribes in 2011 and reported them to Norwegian authorities, consistent with its zero tolerance for graft, it said Wednesday.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 15 January 2014, Yara was fined USD $48 million by Norwegian authorities for paying USD $12 million in bribes between 2004 and 2009, the company said Wednesday. The company admitted bribing senior government officials in India and Libya, including an oil minister of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.<br /><br />On 17 January 2014, Norwegian police indicted four former executives of Yara, including the former chief executive and top legal counsel, charging them with paying USD $8 million in bribes in Libya and India.
