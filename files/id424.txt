        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        On 26 August 2013, in a one-sentence statement, China's Ministry of Supervision said  it was investigating Wang Yongchun, a vice president at state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. for "severe disciplinary violations." It didn't disclose more details, but such phrasing is typically used by Chinese officials when investigating cases of alleged corruption.  The allegations stemmed from CNPC's close ties to Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who has been indicted on war crimes charges.  <br /><br />According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Wang met with energy officials visiting from Indonesia and South Sudan to discuss upstream oil-and-gas development, according to an internal CNPC newsletter.<br /><br />Earlier in 2013, he finished a four-day tour of CNPC's operations in China's northeastern Heilongjiang province with the company's No. 2 official, Liao Yongyuan.<br /><br />The investigation of Mr. Wang comes after the antigraft agency launched a similar probe in May targeting Liu Tienan, one of 10 deputy directors at China's top economic-planning body. Mr. Liu was head of the National Energy Administration from 2008 until March, when he was replaced. Mr. Liu was expelled from China's Communist Party this month and is under investigation for bribe-taking, according to the country's official Xinhua news agency. Mr. Liu wasn't available for comment.
