        <h1>LYONDELL BASELL</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        LyondellBasell Industries ("LyondellBasell")<br />SAT & Co. (Kazakh joint venture partner with Basell—then a separate entity—in 2006)<br />
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Producer of polypropylene and polyethylene, the key ingredients for plastic products
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Rotterdam, Netherlands
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Kazakhstan<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        In its Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on 17 June 2013, LyondellBasell said that it has "identified an agreement related to a former project in Kazakhstan under which a payment was made that raises compliance concerns under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . . ." An earlier Bloomberg News report from 7 April 2010 cited anonymous sources as saying that the Company was specifically looking at a payment of USD $7 million made in Kazakhstan. According to the article, the alleged payment involved a person affiliated with SAT & Co., a Kazakh company owned 50.46 percent by the son-in-law (Kenes Rakishev) of Imangali Tasmagambetov, the former prime minister of Kazakhstan and mayor of the nation's capital of Astana. According to Bloomberg News, SAT & Co., Basell (before it acquired Lyondell), and state-owned KazMunaiGaz Exploration & Production entered into a joint venture in 2006 to develop the project that is now allegedly under investigation. The story cited a LyondellBasell spokesman as saying that the payment of USD $7 million was not properly characterized. The spokesman did not elaborate.<br /><br />On 20 February 2014, LyondellBasell announced in an SEC filing that the DOJ closed its investigation into a payment made in Kazakhstan.  The DOJ ended its investigation without assessing any fine or penalty.
