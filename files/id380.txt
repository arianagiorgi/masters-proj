        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Australian businessman Matthew Ng was originally detained by police in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on November 16, 2010. Ng was formally charged with embezzlement on Nov. 30, 2010 and held on the suspicion of "misappropriation of company assets."  Chinese prosecutors later accused Ng of illegally transferring money between Et-China and a subsidiary, and bribing Guangzhou Officials.<br /><br />Ng was detained amid a dispute between the travel company he founded, ET-China, and Chinese buyers led by Lingnan Group, a hotel and travel conglomerate which is the largest company owned by the Guangzhou municipal government.  Ng's attorney called the bribery charge "ridiculous," and noted that the payment in question was both publicly reported and taxed.
