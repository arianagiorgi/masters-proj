        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Unspecified
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 16 May 2013, China-based Rino International Corp. and two of its executives agreed to settle a lawsuit with U.S. regulators over allegations that the executives looted more USD $3.5 million in company assets and violated the accounting provisions of a U.S. anti-bribery law.<br /><br />The executives, Dejun Zou and Jianping Qiu, who are husband and wife, agreed to pay at least that much money to resolve  additional allegations that they schemed to overstate the revenue of China-based manufacturer of water-treatment equipment, according to court documents. Qiu is the company’s chairman and Zou is the chief executive.<br /><br />Qiu and Zou  neither admitted nor denied the charges and also agreed to pay $100,000 and $150,000 in civil fines, respectively. The pair couldn’t be reached for comment.<br /><br />The couple allegedly used the looted corporate funds to buy a California home, cars and designer clothing, and falsely recorded the expenditures in the company’s books and records, according to the court documents. The alleged false accounting violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes to foreign officials and requires accurate books and records to be kept. The pair allegedly violated the books and records provisions, but not the bribery provisions.
