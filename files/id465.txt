        On 5 February 2013, the Wall Street Journal published an article stating that it had been contacted by São Paulo state prosecutor Marcelo Camargo Milani regarding civil bribery charges that were filed in a São Paulo state court against Brookfield Brazil.  Charges were also allegedly filed against nine other defendants, including two of its top executives and a former employee.<br /><br />According to the company's website, "Brookfield's history in Brazil spans over 100 years of successful operations in various high-quality property, power and infrastructure assets that generate long-term, sustainable cash flow growth."  <br /><br />The Wall Street Journal article goes on to say that the action is related to permits Brookfield received to renovate one of its properties in São Paulo and that "the  charges are part of a broader case that involves São Paulo municipal officials, [including] a public official, a former public official and vendors who allegedly overstated invoices at Brookfield's request to give the extra money to public officials[.]"<br /><br />On 19 November 2013, Brazilian authorities reported that they had begun questioning a company controlled by Brookfield, Brookfield Incorporacoes SA ("BISA").  According to the Wall Street Journal, BISA executives told a São Paulo prosecutor that they were forced by city officials to make $1.7 million in payments to open several new residential projects.  BISA is 45% owned by Brookfield, which also has three directors on the nine-member board.  The lawyer for BISA said the company has paid its taxes in full and that BISA doesn't expect to be charged with any wrongdoing. The lawyer confirmed that BISA made the payments to city officials, but the BISA employee who allegedly made the payments is no longer with the company.<br /><br />According to reports, the total amount paid to the officials was BRL 1.27 million  (approximately USD 644,000).  The prosecutor is purportedly seeking a total of BRL 30 million (approximately USD 15 million) in fines from all defendants.
