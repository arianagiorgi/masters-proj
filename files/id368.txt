        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports on September 17, 2011, the Cuban police shut down Tokmakjian Group's offices in Havana amid allegations of corrupt import-export practices.  Top executives and a number of employees and business partners were reportedly arrested.  <br /><br />Tokmakjian was one of the main western trading firms active in Cuba, selling transportation, mining and construction equipment, among other items, and reportedly earning around CAN 80 million in business annually.  The company is the exclusive distributor for Hyundai in Cuba, among other well-known brands.<br /><br />On 30 June 2014, Reuters reported that Cuban prosecutors are seeking a 15-year prison term for Mr. Tokmakjian, and 20 years for Cuba's former deputy sugar minister accused in the same case.  Prosecutors are seeking a total of USD $91 million in fines and forfeitures from Mr. Tokmakjian, Mr. Puche, and Mr. Vetere.  Prosecutors are seeking 12-year sentences for Mr. Puche and Mr. Vetere.  The three Canadian defendants were held for nearly 2 1/2 years before being charged.
