        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Securency produces secure polymer substrate technology and other unique substrates used in the printing of banknotes and other security documents. The company was formed in 1996 as a joint venture between Australia's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia ("RBA"), and UK-based Innovia Films (Innovia is majority-owned by Candover Investments, a UK private equity firm).  The RBA also owns Note Printing Australia ("NPA"), which is responsible for running the printing works where banknotes are printed. <br /><br />Vietnam<br /><br />In May 2009, The Age, a Melbourne-based newspaper, reported that Securency may have made improper payments to Vietnamese government officials in order to secure a contract in 2002 to supply polymer banknotes to the Vietnamese government.  Securency allegedly hired Hanoi-based Company For Technology and Development ("CFTD") as its local agent because it employed the son of the State Bank of Vietnam's governor.  The company also allegedly partnered with Banktech, a subsidiary of CFTD that was run by the governor's son.  The newspaper alleged that millions of dollars in commissions were made to CFTD and/or Banktech, ostensibly for translation services, organizing meetings and picking up people from the airport.  Some of the payments were allegedly routed through a bank account in Switzerland.<br /><br />On November 19, 2009, federal police raided Securency's offices in Melbourne, as well as the homes of two executives - Myles Curtis, the Managing Director, and John Ellery, the Company Secretary.  According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on March 31, 2010, Curtis and Ellery left the company following the release of a KPMG audit report into the alleged bribery.  Curtis and Ellery had been on suspension since the November raids.  According to the article, the KPMG audit found that, between January 2003 and January 2009, Securency had paid almost AUD 47.5 million in commissions and other payments to a global network of politically connected agents, yielding revenue of AUD 361.4 million.   <br /><br />The UK Serious Fraud Office joined the investigation, as two of Securency's sales executives conducted much of their work from England.  On October 6, 2010, over 80 UK SFO investigators raided nine properties (eight residential premises and one commercial property) across the UK.  Two Britons were arrested.  The Australian and Spanish authorities carried out related raids as well.  <br /><br />On October 15, 2010, the UK SFO announced that three additional individuals had been arrested in connection with the matter.  <br /><br />According to press reports, the company's activities in India also became part of the investigation. <br /><br />Additional press reports on 7 August 2012 suggest that the Reserve Bank of Australia suppressed evidence of secret commissions paid to middle men hired by Securency or NPA to secure bank note contracts in Malaysia and Nepal. A press release by the RBA issued on 22 August 2012 vehemently denies the media allegations, and explains that ongoing judicial proceedings prevented the release of the relevant documents.   No RBA employees have been charged in the case.<br /><br />Nigeria Allegations<br /><br />Media sources allege that in connection with the 2006 deal to supply NGN 1.9 billion in banknotes to the Central Bank of Nigeria, Securency paid NGN 750 million (approximately USD 4.6 million) in bribes, and that much of the bribe money was transferred into bank accounts in tax havens belonging to two UK businessmen.  Some media reports name the two businessmen.  The reports allege that the funds were transferred from the businessmen's accounts to those of Nigerian officials, and that the transactions took place between 2006 and 2009.<br /><br />Malaysia<br /><br />It is alleged that NPA and Securency paid a Malaysian arms broker to pass bribes to Malaysian Central Bank officials.  Media reports allege that NPA set up a project caled Exocet, through which they paid Kayum AUD 3 million between 2003 and 2007.  The commissions paid to Kayum' -- up to 20% -- raised concerns with some NPA executives in 2007.  But, according to media sources, NPA held a board meeting in September 2007, attended by the RBA assistant governor, the Securency and NPA chairman, and others, at which participants were informed that Securency was planning to pay Kayum a secret commission of AUD 492,000 that would be hidden in an overpriced banknote contract.  When, in 2008 Kayum wrote a letter reminding the RBA that he "managed to personally convince my prime minister/finance minister and the Malaysian cabinet to accept and adopt polymer bank note technology," NPA gave him an additional AUD 600,000 in commissions.<br /><br />Following these revelations, the RBA issued a statement to the press, noting that there had been no attempt by the bank to hide information from the authorities, and that the "bank's executives acted in good faith and with integrity."<br /><br />The assistant governor of the MCB and the arms dealer, Abdul Kayum, were later arrested.<br /><br />RBA Response to Allegations<br /><br />Media accounts published in September 2012 allege that despite receiving written notice of the bribery in 2007, RBA governor Glenn Stevens and top executives remained silent for years, or worse.  These allegations are answered in a comprehensive statement made by Glenn Stevens, governor of the RBA, in an opening speech to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics on 8 October 2012.  A memorandum elaborating this statements was also submitted to the committee.<br /><br />Stevens first declares the purpose of his address:  to review the background of Securency and NPA, to review "in detail the sequence of events that began with the Reserve Bank Board asking about the use of foreign sales agents" by Securency and NPA, and to give "an account of the way Securency, NPA and the Reserve Bank behaved after the allegations...were aired in the media in May 2009."<br /><br />2006-2007<br /><br />In 2006 Securency and NPA were asked by the Board of the RBA to articulate their policies on the employment of agents.  In February 2007 the RBA board asked the companies to achieve faster progress on implementing policies regarding the employment of agents and the assurance of ethical conduct.  <br /><br />The manager of NPA raised concerns about two of NPA's agents in April 2007, which were presented at the NPA Board meeting in May 2007.   In a report to the Board, it was noted that two of the three agents had not signed the required affirmation and one had failed to provide a written response regarding improper conduct, as required by NPA's policies.  Therefore, at the May 2007 NPA board meeting, it was decided to terminate the contracts of two agents and conduct a review of all agent files. Recommendations were made to the RBA, which concluded in June 2007 that a further investigation needed to be conducted, and that Securency should be asked to report on its use of agents, and that NPA should cease using agents.  The NPA board concluded on 29 August 2007 that, "after an extensive investigation with assistance from external lawyers, the sub-committee had identified instances of weakness in controls and documentation, and in contract management, but it had found no evidence of illegality or impropriety by NPA managers and staff."<br /><br />A similar audit was commissioned regarding Securency's agency practices; as a result, Securency terminated its Malaysian agency agreement as of 15 July 2007.  Another audt of Securency was conducted in 2008.  A settlement was reached in September 2007 with NPA's terminated agent, and NPA's board was notified in May 2008.  Likewise, arrangements were made to pay Securency's terminated agent for work performed prior to the termination. <br /><br />2009-2010<br /><br />According to the 8 October 2012 press statement, in May 2009, after receiving inquiries from the newspaper The Age, the new Securency Chairman first contacted the auditors KPMG to ask that it conduct a review of Securency's agent policies and procedures.  When the newspaper article was published, the Securency Chairman (B. Rankin) contacted the Australian Federal Police ("AFP") and "proposed that an investigation be conducted."    Securency informed the AFP about the prior audit, but the AFP did not request the documents produced by the audit until January 2010.  Securency refrained from engaging KPMG in order not to hinder the AFP investigation.  With the AFP's approval, KPMG was later engaged by the companies in July 2009 to conduct an independent audit.<br /><br />As a result of the audit, Securency learned from KPMG in October 2009 that "concerns about possible corrupt payments had been raised by a Securency employee with Securency senior management in early 2007. These concerns had never been made known to the Securency Board or the Audit Department when it conducted either the 2007 or 2008 audits. At the time the CEO and CFO of Securency were stood down and the use of agents suspended pending further inquiry. The preliminary findings reported by KPMG also indicated that there had been failures to fully implement the procedures specified in Securency's agent policies and procedures."<br /><br />In conclusion, the RBA press statement notes that "the persons charged with wrongdoing are no longer with either company," and that "the use of foreign sales agents at NPA ceased in 2007...NPA these days operates under a tighter charter to keep its focus more closely aligned with the Bank's core objectives and risk tolerance."  Use of sales agents by Securency was discontinued after the KPMG report.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The conduct appears to have been uncovered by the investigative reporting of The Age newspaper.  According to Securency, following The Age's allegations in May 2009, the company referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police ("AFP").  The AFP commenced an investigation shortly thereafter and then executed search warrants on the company's premises and the executives' homes in November 2009. <br /><br />In July 2009, Securency engaged KPMG to conduct a forensic investigation into the allegations and to review the company's compliance policies and procedures regarding the retention of commercial intermediaries.  According to Securency, the investigation preliminarily found that a Securency employee filed an internal complaint with management in 2007, after which management conducted an internal investigation and concluded that no action was required.  This information was not disclosed to Securency's Board or to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s auditors who conducted a compliance audit shortly thereafter.<br /><br />In November 2009, Securency's Board asked Curtis and Ellery to "stand aside" from their positions as the investigation continued.  The Board also suspended overseas marketing activities involving foreign agents.<br /><br />Media accounts published in September 2012 allege that despite receiving written notice of the bribery in 2007, RBA governor Glenn Stevens and top executives remained silent for years, or worse.  These allegations are answered in a comprehensive statement made by Glenn Stevens, governor of the RBA, in an opening speech to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics on 8 October 2012.<br /><br />Stevens first declares the purpose of his address:  to review the background of Securency and NPA, to review "in detail the sequence of events that began with the Reserve Bank Board asking about the use of foreign sales agents" by Securency and NPA, and to give "an account of the way Securency, NPA and the Reserve Bank behaved after the allegations...were aired in the media in May 2009."
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        Australia<br /><br />On July 1, 2011, the Australian Federal Police ("AFP") charged Securency and its sister company, Note Printing Australia ("NPA"), with bribery of foreign public officials in connection with alleged bribes paid to public officials in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam between 1999 and 2005 - through international sales agents - in order to secure banknote contracts.  Six individuals from Victoria - who previously worked for Securency or NPA as chief executives, chief financial officers or sales agents - were arrested and charged as well.  According to the AFP, the Australian arrests coincided with related bribery charges laid against two individuals in Malaysia by the Malaysian Attorney General’s Chambers, following an investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.  <br /><br />The charges against Securency and NPA carry a maximum fine of AUD 330,000 per offense.  The charges against the six individuals carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of AUD 1.1 million, under sections 11.5(1) and 70.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995. <br /><br />On 27 October 2011, both NPA and Securency entered guilty pleas at the Melbourne Magistrate’s Court to three charges each of bribing or conspiring to bribe foreign officials to obtain a business advantage<br /><br />On 12 March 2012, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) released a statement that it did not intend to prosecute  Securency International Pty Ltd and Note Printing Australia Limited, noting, "ASIC considers a range of factors when deciding to investigate and possibly take enforcement action. In line with its normal practice, ASIC has reviewed this material from the AFP for possible directors’ duty breaches of the Corporations Act and has decided not to proceed to a formal investigation. ASIC intends to make no further comment on this matter."<br /><br />Australia: Ellery<br /><br />On 18 July 2012, David John Ellery, who served as Securency’s CFO, pleaded guilty to a charge of false accounting in relation to a AUD 79,502 payment to Kuala Lumpur arms broker Abdul Kayum Syed Ahmad.  Specifically, Ellery admitted that he created a false document to facilitate a payment to Kayum even though he knew the latter  was not entitled to it.  Ellery is one of nine individuals to have been indicted by the Australian Federal Police.  In accepting his guilty plea, the Victoria Supreme Court acknowledged Ellery's willingness to testify against the eight remaining defendants.  Ellery's counsel noted that his client had not been involved in a wider conspiracy, and falsified documents at the behest of his superiors, and even that Ellery had warned senior colleagues at Securency that Kayum was not entitled to any money from the company. <br /><br />Following a hearing on 18 July 2012, the Supreme Court of Victoria (Melbourne) issued a sentencing judgment on 20 August 2012.  Ellery's offenses could invoke a maximum 10 year prison sentence.  The judge went to great lengths to explain Ellery's offense and the court's reasoning.  Ellery approved a commission payment to Kayum in Malaysia of AUD 79,502.  Later, when an invoice fabricated by Kayum reflected the same amount but showed an itemized list of "expenses," Ellery forwarded it for payment.  When questioned about the "expenses" subsequently, Ellery concealed the nature of the payment.  In his favor, the judge noted that Ellery did not create the false document, did not at first wish to approve it, ultimately approved it without any idea of personal gain.  When confronted, Ellery pleaded guilty early in the proceedings, and agreed to cooperate in ongoing investigations both of Securency and NPA offenses in Malaysia and other jurisdictions.<br />The judge therefore sentenced Ellery to 6 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, meaning that the sentence could be imposed if, at any time during the coming two years, Ellery commits another offense punishable by imprisonment.<br /><br />Australia: Other Individuals<br /><br />Amended charge sheets were issued against 8 individuals on 14 August 2012:  Anderson, Boillot, Brady, Curtis, Gerathy, Hutchinson, Leckenby and  Marchant.

Together, Ellery and the other eight defendants are alleged to have made or authorized over AUD 1.6 million in improper payments.<br /><br />United Kingdom<br /><br />On 8 September 2012, the SFO charged William ("Bill") Lowther with one count of conspiracy to corrupt during 2003.  Lowther first appeared in court on 20 September, and pleaded not guilty at a hearing in March.  On 26 November 2012, his trial began Southwark Crown Court.<br /><br />At the trial, prosecutors claimed that Lowther was the driving force behind Securency, and that the company was desperate to turn a profit and pay back start-up loans.  In order to secure two dozen note printing contracts with Vietnam worth GBP 90 million, Lowther arranged to send the son of the governor of the State Bank of Vietnam to Durham Business School in Britain.  Lowther is alleged to have arranged for an interview at the school, driven Le Duc Minh, Le Duc Thuy's son, to the interview, and thereafter arranged for the payment of GBB 18,000 in tuition, in addition to GPB 3,400 for rooming expenses for Minh. <br /><br />Media reports dated 24 October 2012 that the SFO is also investigating corruption by Securency in certain African nations.<br /><br />Malaysia<br /><br />The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigation -  On 1 July 2011, the MACC reported that Abdul Kayum bin Syed Ahmad, 62 years, Director of Aksavest Sdn.

The second charge is for a similar offence allegedly committed on 15th February 2005 at the same venue." Likewise, another press release was issued by the MACC on the same day, noting that "Dato’ Mohamad Daud bin Dol Moin was earlier charged this morning at the Special Courts for Corruption at Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur Court Complex on two counts of charges for accepting the gratification from the accused, Abdul Kayum bin Syed Ahmad."<br /><br />Nigeria<br /><br />Media sources allege that on 11 January 2013, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria (the EFCC) arrested Charles Chukwuma Soludo at his Abuja residence, and detained him for questioning in connection with the note printing contract with Securency.  Soludo served as the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria between 2006 and 2008.  Media reports indicated that in addition to Soludo, 12 senior former CBN and Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company officials were also arrested.     <br /><br />Indonesia<br /><br />The Indonesian investigation into the companies may be ongoing, as well as investigations in Vietnam and Nepal.
