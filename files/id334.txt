        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Riad El-Taher, a British citizen, admitted to making four illegal payments to the Iraqi Government in 2001 totalling over USD 500,000 in order to secure lucrative oil contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Programme. During this period, payments to Iraq could legally only be made after a licence had been granted by Her Majesty's Treasury.  El-Taher had neither obtained nor sought any such licence.<br /><br />The contracts obtained by the illegal payments were for two million barrels of oil valued at over $50 million. This oil was sold for a profit of over $600,000, most of which was deposited in an offshore bank account controlled by El-Taher.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        After the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq, the United Nations set up a committee to investigate sanctions breaches. In the committee's findings published in October 2005, El-Taher was identified as one of the individuals involved in breaking sanctions.
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        The SFO commenced an investigation which led to the arrest of El-Taher in August 2008.  He was charged in August 2009 and pleaded guilty to all charges on January 13, 2011.  On February 25, 2011, El-Taher was sentenced to 10 months in jail.  <br /><br />The UK made the breach of United Nation sanctions on Iraq a criminal offence in by legislation implemented in 1990 and 2000.  El-Taher pleaded guilty to offences under the legislation implemented in 2000 - i.e., The Iraq (United Nations Sanctions) Order 2000 (Statutory Instrument 3241) - which made it a criminal offence to make funds available to the Iraqi Government without a licence granted by HM Treasury.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>The UK SFO has pursued both companies and individuals involved in breaches of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq in the early 2000's.</li></ul>
