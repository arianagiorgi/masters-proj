        <h1>ITXC</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        ITXC Corporation ("ITXC")<br />Steven J. Ott (Executive Vice-President of Global Sales for ITXC)<br />Roger Michael Young (Managing Director for Africa and the Middle East for ITXC)<br />Yaw Osei Amoako (Regional Director for Africa for ITXC)<br />
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Global telecommunications services
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Princeton, New Jersey, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Senegal<br />Mali<br />Rwanda<br />Ghana<br />Nigeria<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ and SEC alleged that, between September 1999 and October 2004, ITXC employees - Amoako, Ott and Young - conspired to make improper payments to Sonatel (a telecommunications company partially-owned by the Senegalese and French governments), Rwandatel (a telecommunications company wholly-owned by the Rwandan government) and Nitel (a telecommunications company wholly-owned by the Nigerian government) for the purposes of obtaining contracts to enable the placement of calls between ITXC's carriers and the aforementioned companies throughout their respective regions.<br /><br />It was also alleged that, in two other instances, ITXC offered to retain the services of officials from Ghana Telecom (a telecommunications company partially-owned by the Ghana government) and Sotelma (a telecommunications company wholly owned by the Mali government), although ultimately no agreements were entered into and no payments were made.<br /><br />Beginning in 2001, Amoako, Ott and Young, along with approximately three other unnamed co-conspirators, made "commission payments" to a Sonatel official for the purposes of obtaining Sonatel's business.  As a result, ITXC obtained the contract on 14 February 2001 and, on 15 March 2001, the Sonatel official was hired by ITXC as a sales representative under a Non-Exclusive Regional Agency Agreement.  Between March 2001 and October 2003, this official was paid USD 74,772.06 via wire-transfers from New Jersey.  In addition, Amoako embezzled USD 100,411 between 2001 and 2004 in connection with this contract.<br /><br />Similarly, in 2002, improper "commission payments" were made to a Rwandatel official for the purposes of obtaining Rwandatel's business.  As a result, ITXC obtained a Rwandatel contract on 28 February 2002 and, on 2 July 2002, the official was hired by ITXC as a sales representative.  In September 2002, the official was allegedly paid USD 26,155.11 via wire-transfers from New Jersey.  <br /><br />Finally, in 2002, improper payments (in the form of a "retainer" and as a percentage of profits from the contract) were made to a Nitel official for the purposes of obtaining Nitel's business.  As a result, ITXC obtained the contract on 25 October 2002 and, in mid-November 2002, the official was hired by ITXC as a sales representative under the guise of being the CEO of a fictitious company called Standard Digital International Ltd. ("Standard Digital").   Between 2002 and 2004, the Nitel official was paid USD 166,541.31 (in three separate payments) via wire-transfers from a New Jersey PNC Bank to Standard Digital's account at the Intercontinental Bank PLC in Nigeria.  As a result of this contract, ITXC earned profits totaling USD 1,136,618.  For his part, Amoako received a USD 50,000 kickback.<br /><br />In the ITXC's books and records, the payments were described as "agent's fees," "settlement payments," "commission payments" and "retainer fees" on connection with fictitious sales representative agreements.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        The improper payments were uncovered during pre-acquisition due diligence by Teleglobe International Holdings Ltd. ("Teleglobe"), which acquired ITXC in early 2004.  <br /><br />Teleglobe was later acquired by Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. ("VSNL") in 2006.<br />
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 6 September 2006, Amoako pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  On 26 July 2007, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, including 6 months in a halfway house, and 2 years of probation.  Amoako agreed to a criminal fine of USD 7,500.  <br /><br />On 25 July 2007, Ott pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act.  On 21 July 2008, he was sentenced to 5 years of probation (including 6 months in a community corrections center and 6 months in home confinement) and agreed to a criminal fine of USD 10,000 plus interest.  <br /><br />On 25 July 2007, Young pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel Act.  On 2 September 2008, he was sentenced to 5 years of probation (including 3 months in community confinement and 3 months in home confinement) and agreed to a criminal fine of USD 7,000 plus interest.  <br /><br />On 18 April 2008, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Amoako, Ott and Young each consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the FCPA.  Amoako was also ordered to pay USD 188,435 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Frequently, employee misconduct involving bribe payments to foreign officials will also involve the employee engaging in embezzlement, arranging for kickbacks or pursuing other means of self-enrichment.</li><li>Employees of partially state-owned entities, such as the main telecommunications company in certain countries, will likely constitute "foreign officials" under the FCPA.</li></ul>
