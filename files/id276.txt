        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports, in January 2009, the Korea Fair Trade Commission ("FTC") fined four multinational and three local pharmaceutical companies a combined 20.4 billion won for unfair business practices in connection with the sale and marketing of products to Korean hospitals.  The improper conduct included gifts, travel and consulting fees provided to hospital staff, as well as other improper rebates and kickback arrangements. <br /><br />In a similar case two years later, the FTC fined five additional multinational pharmaceutical companies approximately USD 9.3 million for similar conduct, along with one domestic drugmaker.  According to press reports, the companies allegedly organized free seminars and conferences for doctors, clinics and hospitals, around which they then offered improper golf outings, spa treatments, movie showings, dinners, gifts of carpets and wine, speaking and consulting fees as well as cash.  The benefits were provided ostensibly for post-marketing surveillance.
