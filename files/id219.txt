        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Raytheon described the ongoing investigation as follows in its SEC Form 10-K filed on 23 February 2011:<br /><br />"We are currently conducting a self-initiated internal review of certain of our international operations, focusing on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In the course of the review, we have identified several possible areas of concern relating to payments made in connection with certain international operations related to a jurisdiction where we do business. We have voluntarily contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission and the DoJ to advise both agencies that an internal review is underway. Because the internal review is ongoing, we cannot predict the ultimate consequences of the review. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that the results of this review will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity."
