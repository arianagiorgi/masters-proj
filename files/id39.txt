        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According the SEC's complaint, in April 2004, Immucor Italia paid EUR 13,500 to the director of a public hospital in Milan, Italy, in exchange for the director favoring Immucor in certain contracts for blood-testing equipment and supplies.   The payments were made through a local sales agent, who submitted a payment request describing the EUR 13,500 as the hospital director's overdue compensation for his participation in a conference at the request of Immucor Italia in October 2003.  The agents payment request also requested that the payment be made to a Swiss bank account for the benefit of the hospital director.<br /><br />Gioacchino De Chirico, Immucor's CEO, allegedly approved an invoice falsely describing the EUR 13,500 payment as a consulting fee for services in connection with business opportunities in Switzerland, services that De Chirico knew the hospital director never performed.  He authorized the payment to be made through Immucor Germany in order to assist the hospital director in avoiding Italian taxes.<br /><br />The SEC charged that Immucor violated and that Di Chirico violated and aided and abetted Immucor's violations of  the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions in connection with this conduct.
