Dalman had been leading the internal investigation of the corruption allegations involving the Company. The Guardian also reported the UK Serious Fraud Office's ("SFO") announcement that it has initiated a criminal investigation of ENRC and "[t]he focus of the investigation will be fraud, bribery and corruption relating to the activities of the company or its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan and Africa."  ENRC confirmed the existence of the investigation and said that it is cooperating with the SFO.<br /><br />On 30 April 2013, Reuters reported that ENRC is also internally investigating allegations of corruption related to its acquisition of mining concessions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
