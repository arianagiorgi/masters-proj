        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to a Reuters story from 17 October 2011, Cuban police closed the Havana offices of British investment fund Coral Capital and arrested its CEO, Amado Fakhre, in connection with a corruption investigation. Reuters reported on 31 May 2013 that Fakhre "faced various bribery charges related mainly to the fund's import business" and that his two-day trial ended on 31 May 2013. Reuters also reported that media were not permitted to observe the trial, and Cuba's state-run media outlet has not released any details about the case.

        According to Reuters, Fakhre's bribery trial began on 30 May 2013 and ended the following day. On 20 June 2013, Fakhre was released from custody on the previous day.
