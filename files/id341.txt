        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        Canada: Royal Canadian Mounted Police<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Blackfire Exploration Ltd. ("Blackfire")<br />Blackfire Exploration Mexico S de RL de CV (Blackfire's wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary)<br />Julio César Velazquez Calderón, the mayor of a town in the Mexican State of Chiapas
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Exploration and mining company
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Calgary, Canada
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Mexico<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        In March 2010, a coalition of nine Canadian non-governmental organizations, led by MiningWatch Canada, asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Anti-Corruption Unit (RCMP-AICU) to investigate Calgary-based Blackfire Exploration Ltd. for possible bribery in violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA) in connection with the company's activities in Mexico.  <br /><br />Blackfire is a Canadian and Mexican owned exploration and mining company with assets in British Columbia, Canada and Chiapas, Mexico.  The company operates in Mexico through its wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary company, Blackfire Exploration Mexico S de RL de CV.  It has Canadian and Mexican mineral properties at various stages of development.<br /><br />Blackfire owns a barite mine near Chicomueselo, in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, which has been subject to protests by anti-mining activists, particularly since the murder of activist Mariano Abarco in front of his home in November 2009 (the event that eventually precipitated the corruption investigation).  According to the NGO group, Blackfire made a series of improper payments to the mayor of Chicomueselo, and provided benefits such as free airline tickets, in exchange for unspecified favors and assistance.  Media reports claim that Blackfire paid Mayor Velazquez CAD 19,300 "to keep the peace and prevent local members of the community from taking up arms against the mine."

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Canadian NGOs, including MiningWatch Canada, began investigating Blackfire's operations in Chicomueselo following the death of an anti-mining activist in November 2009.  On 10 March 2010, the NGOs filed a formal memo with the RCMP requesting a formal investigation into Blackfire's alleged violations of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA).  
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        Although the RCMP does not publicize its CFPOA investigations, it is likely that it has an ongoing formal investigation of Blackfire underway in connection with this matter. <br /><br />According to press reports on 29 August 2011, the RCMP raided Blackfire's offices in Calgary on July 20.
