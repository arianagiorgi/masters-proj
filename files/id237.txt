        United States: Department of Justice<br />United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />India: Central Bureau of Investigation<br />

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Xerox described the ongoing investigation as follows in its 2009 Annual Report:<br /><br />"We became aware of a number of matters at our Indian subsidiary, Xerox India Ltd. (formerly Xerox Modicorp Ltd.), much of which occurred over several years before we obtained majority ownership of these operations in mid-1999. These matters include misappropriations of funds and payments to other companies that may have been inaccurately recorded on the subsidiary’s books, certain alleged improper payments in connection with sales to government customers and allegations that Xerox India’s then senior officers were aware of such activities. These transactions were not material to the Company’s financial statements. In 2002, we reported these transactions to the Indian authorities, the U.S. Department of Justice and to the SEC. As previously disclosed, following these reports, Indian authorities have advanced the position that Xerox India violated the Indian Company Law by means of alleged improper payments and alleged defaults/ failures of the Xerox India, Ltd. board of directors.  Xerox India has asserted that the alleged violations are generally unsubstantiated and without any basis in law. We believe that any fines or penalties that might be imposed in connection with such ongoing matters would not be material to the Company."<br /><br />According to press reports, Xerox India is alleged to have made USD 700,000 in improper payments in 2000 to Indian officials to procure contracts to supply office equipment.
