        <h1>KEYUAN </h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Securities and Exchange Commission <br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Keyuan Petrochemicals, Inc. ("Keyuan")<br />Aichun Li, former Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") of Keyuan
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Leading independent manufacturer and supplier of petrochemicals in China
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Ningbo, Zhejiang , China
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        China<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Keyuan described the ongoing investigation as follows in its Form 10-K submitted to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission ("SEC") on 20 October 2011:<br /><br />"The Company's former auditor, KPMG, LLP ('KPMG'), brought certain issues to the Company's Audit Committee's attention through a March 28, 2011 memorandum and an April 18, 2011 letter (collectively, the 'KPMG Memoranda'). KPMG requested<br />that the Company's Audit Committee conduct an independent investigation (the 'Investigation') into those issues. On March 31, 2011, the Audit Committee elected to commence such independent Investigation and engaged the services of independent counsel, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP ('Pillsbury'), which in turn engaged the services of Deloitte Financial Advisory Services LLP ('Deloitte'), as independent forensic accountants, and King & Wood, as Audit Committee counsel in the People's Republic of China ('PRC'). Pillsbury, Deloitte and King & Wood are collectively referred to herein as the 'Investigation Team.' On September 28, 2011 the investigation was completed. The Investigation identified possible violations of PRC laws and U.S. Securities laws, including the maintenance of an off-balance sheet cash account that was used primarily to pay service providers and other Company related expenses. Total activity in the off-balance sheet cash account amounted to approximately $800,000 through December 31, 2010 with a net income statement effect of approximately $12,000, and $400,000 for the period from January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2011, with a net income statement effect of approximately $192,000, at which time the Company ceased its use. The Investigation identified certain other issues that could result in potential violations of PRC or U.S. laws. The Company is working with its legal counsel to evaluate the matters identified in the Investigation and to determine the extent to which the Company may be exposed to fines and penalties. In addition, the Company has retained a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA') expert to review potentially relevant transactions and to assist the Company with the design and implementation of a detailed FCPA program. The Company has preliminarily concluded that the extent to which it may be exposed in the PRC is limited. However, management is currently unable to determine the final outcome of these matters and their possible effects on the consolidated financial statements."<br /><br />Keyuan was delisted by the NASDAQ exchange on 6 October 2011.<br /><br />On 28 February 2013, the SEC announced that it charged Keyuan and former CFO Aichun Li for multiple alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including provisions of the FCPA. The SEC also announced that Keyuan and Li settled the charges with the SEC by paying fines of USD 1 million (Keyuan) and USD 25,000 (Li). The complaint alleges that Keyuan's "off-balance sheet cash account" existed from at least July 2008 to March 2011 and was not recorded in the Company's books. The account was allegedly used, among other things, to "fund gifts--both cash and non-cash--for Chinese government officials." The officials included those from "local environmental, port, police, and fire departments." The complaint also alleges a number of other violations, including the omission from SEC filings of numerous transactions in 2010 and 2011, and that Li failed to adequately investigate a number of these accounting red flags. As a result of the allegations, Keyuan and Li were charged with violations of the FCPA's books and records provisions.
