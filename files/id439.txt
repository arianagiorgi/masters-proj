        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Media reports on 30 May 2012 revealed that the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs submitted a file for investigation to the U.K. Serious Fraud Investigation Office ("SFO"), following a complaint filed by Adidas AG in Gurgaon, a suburb of New Delhi where many company headquarters are located.  The requested probe focuses on alleged criminal conduct by two former Reebok India executives, Mr.  Prem and Mr.  Bhagat, who have publicly denied the charges.  Mr. Prem was managing director of Reebok India, and Mr. Bhagat served as Chief Operating Officer. The two men are suspected of fraud, theft and accounting malpractices resulting in losses of INR 8.7 billion (approximately USD 160 million) for the Company. <br /><br />Specifically, media sources allege that the economic crimes unit of the Gurgaon police found that Mr. Singh and Mr. Bhatt secretly rented four warehouses and used them to store goods which they claimed had been supplied to bona fide dealers.  But the goods were sold to distributors across the country.  In an interview prior to his arrest in September 2012, former Managing Director Prem explained that sales arrangements with retailers included minimum sales requirements, which resulted in the Company compensating retailers for items not sold.  But some sources allege that the arrangement involved kickbacks to Mr. Prem and his colleagues.<br /><br />Adidas confirmed the irregularities at Reebok India in a press release on 30 April 2012:  <br /><br />"Management also announces that commercial irregularities discovered at Reebok India Company, in India, will  likely affect the consolidated financial statements of the Adidas Group. The currently estimated maximum negative impact could be up to a  pre-tax amount of € 125 million. Due to the sensitivity of the on-going investigation, specific details will be disclosed as appropriate in due course. . . . Management assures its stakeholders that it has, and will continue to, vigorously pursue a course of action to protect the Group’s interests, which has  already resulted in the appointment of a new local leadership team in India at the end of March."<br /><br />The statements in the press release were repeated in Adidas' half-year report issued in July 2012.<br /><br />Some, however, allege that the corruption allegations are nothing more than an attempt by Adidas to lower the value of Reebok India in advance of a buy-out of <br />the minority shareholder in the company.  Both Mr. Prem and former COO Mr. Bhagat filed lawsuits in June 2012 in the Delhi High Court, in which they claim that they were asked to "carry out certain illegal and unethical actions" by the Adidas Group, such as manipulating accounts, booking irrelevant expenses and cancelling large distributorships, to ensure that the market value of Reebok India fell significantly.

The five men appeared in court on 20 September 2012.<br /><br />Mr. Prem has apparently initiated a defamation claim against his former employer.
