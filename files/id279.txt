        China: People's Procuratorate<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Mitsui & Co., Ltd. ("Mitsui")<br />Part-time employee of Mitsui's branch in China
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Japanese general trading firm
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Tokyo, Japan

        China<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports, a 63-year old part-time employee of Mitsui's branch in China was convicted by the Chinese Higher People's Court for paying bribes to Chinese officials in connection with the company's bid to build a power station.<br /><br />The employee apparently paid a USD 61,000 bribe to a vice minister, Zha Ke-Ming, in the (now defunct) Ministry for Electric Power Generation in order to obtain inside information about bidding requirements during the tender in 1997, which Mitsui then won.  <br /><br />The employee also apparently paid a USD 45,000 bribe to Tan Ai-Xing, former head of a state power company's international cooperation division in 1998 in connection with the financing of the power station contract.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        According to Chinese press reports, the Mitsui case was discovered during the investigation of another case codenamed "the 3.13 case" (a wide-spread national security investigation case against one individual, Fang Fu-ming).  Fang was arrested in 1999 on various accounts including selling national trade secrets and bribing government officials.  
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        According to press reports, the Beijing Higher People's Court convicted the Mitsui employee for bribery and sentenced him to a two-year prison term, to be followed by deportation.  <br /><br />The bribe-recipients - the division head and the vice minister - were each sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2001 for their roles in the matter.
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>In many countries, depending on local law provisions relating to corporate liability, employees acting on behalf of companies will be prosecuted for bribery while the company itself is absolved.</li></ul>
