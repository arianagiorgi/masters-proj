        <h1>F.G. MASON ENGINEERING</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        F.G. Mason Engineering, Inc. ("MEI")<br />Francis G. Mason (President and sole stockholder of MEI) 
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Development and sale of anti-bugging devices 
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Fairfield, Connecticut, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Germany<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ charged MEI and Mason with conspiring to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions in connection with improper payments made to Dirk Ekkehard Zoeller, an official at the Militaerischer Abschirmenst, or the West German Military Intelligence Service (known by the acronym MAD), from April 1983 through October 1989.  The payments were made to secure a procurement contract from MAD for the development, production and servicing of a new technical security countermeasure ("TSCM") device called the MICRO-G, as well as related equipment and software.  [TSCM devices, also known as "anti-bugging" devices, are designed to detect the presence of electronic surveillance.]<br /><br />MEI and Mason promised Zoeller kickbacks worth 13.3% of the revenue received under the MAD procurement contracts and 50% of the revenue earned from "general alignment" charges under the related service contracts.  MEI and Mason inflated the prices on its contracts with MAD in order to cover the cost of the kickbacks.  Zoeller used his procurement authority at MAD to steer the award of the TSCM contract to MEI.
