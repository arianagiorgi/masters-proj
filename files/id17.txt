        <h1>HIOKI</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Misao Hioki 
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Industrial rubber products
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Tokyo, Japan
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Argentina<br />Brazil<br />Ecuador<br />Mexico<br />Venezuela<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        The DOJ charged Hioki with conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act and conspiracy to violate the FCPA, in connection with his role in bid rigging and the bribery of foreign government officials, respectively, while serving as General Manager of the International Engineering Products Division ("IEP") of a Tokyo-based manufacturer of marine hoses and related products (identified in the press as the Bridgestone Corporation).  Marine hose is a flexible rubber hose used to transfer oil between tankers and storage facilities.  <br /><br />Between January 2007 and May 2004, Hioki allegedly conspired to rig bids, fix prices and allocate market shares of marine hose in the U.S. and elsewhere and conspired to make improper payments to employees of government-owned entities in Latin America, including in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, and Venezuela.  Hioki and his co-conspirators allegedly approved the making of payments to the government officials through local sales agents.  The payments were concealed within the commissions paid to the agents.  The improper payments were made to secure business for the company and its U.S. subsidiary and were coordinated through the subsidiarys office in Houston, Texas.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Hioki was one of eight foreign executive arrested on 2 May 2007 in Houston and San Francisco and charged for their roles in the marine hose cartel, after participating in a cartel meeting in Houston.  
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 10 December 2008, Hioki pleaded guilty to two felony counts: conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act and conspiracy to violate the FCPA.  Hioki was sentenced to two years in jail and fined USD 80,000. <br /><br />Hioki was the ninth individual to plead guilty in the marine house bid-rigging investigation and the first individual to plead guilty in the FCPA conspiracy.  He agreed to cooperate in the DOJ's ongoing antitrust and FCPA investigations. 
        
        <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <ul><li>Other DOJ investigations, such as antitrust or domestic bribery cases, can lead to the discovery of conduct violating the FCPA.</li></ul>
