        <h1>KOSMOS / EO</h1>
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h2>
        United States: Department of Justice<br />Ghana: Attorney General Department<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Kosmos Energy LLC ("Kosmos")<br />E.O. Group (joint venture established by Kosmos' representative in Ghana and Ghanaian businessmen close to the country's president, John Kufuor) ("EO")<br />MODEC, Inc. (general EPC contractor and operator of floating production systems; partner on the Jubilee Field development) ("Modec")<br />Anadarko Petroleum Corporation<br />Tullow Oil PLC<br />Ghana National Petroleum Corporation<br />Sabre Oil and Gas Limited<br />SOG Company, a British Virgin Islands company<br />Tsatsu Tsikata
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Oil and gas exploration
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>
        Dallas, Texas, United States
        
        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        Ghana<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        According to press reports, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Ghanaian Attorney General Department investigated Kosmos and EO for potential wrongdoing in connection with EO's securing of a stake in the country's promising West Cape Three Points offshore oil block on favorable terms for itself and Kosmos.  It was suspected that EO used its access to top Ghanaian officials to improperly secure the deal.  <br /><br />MODEC is alleged to have awarded a USD 5 million contract for "Advisory Services" to a British Virgin Islands (Tortola) company called SOG, which is 50% owned by Tsatsu Tsikata, who had connections to the president, John Kofi Agyekum Kufuor (president between 2001-2009; the contract was awarded in 2008).

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        Unspecified
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        On 12 May 2010, Kosmos received a declination letter from the DOJ stating that the Department did not intend to take any enforcement action and had closed its inquiry into the matter.  <br /><br />On 2 June 2010, EO received a similar declination letter from the DOJ.<br /><br />In subsequent SEC filings, Kosmos does not mention any pending FCPA issues (for example, in SEC Form 10-K, filed 1 March 2012).<br /><br />It appears that Ghanaian authorities' investigation into EO (but not Kosmos) remains ongoing.<br /><br />Kosmos remains exposed to FCPA liabilities, however, as one of its partners in the Jubilee project is under investigation.  MODEC, the contractor for the floating production, storage and offloading ("FPSO") facility for the Jubilee Field Phase 1 development is reportedly under investigation "for certain potential FCPA violations by the Jubilee Unit partners and the syndicate of international banks who had committed to refinance the construction costs of the FPSO (a portion of such costs were originally loaned by the Jubilee Unit partners, including Kosmos)" (see Kosmos SEC Form S-1, dated 13 January 2011, attached).  Modec, however, issued a press release on 23 January 2011 stating that its internal investigation found no evidence of an FCPA violation (see attached press release).
