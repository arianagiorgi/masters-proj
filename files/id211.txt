        Norsk Hydro describes the ongoing investigation as follows in a recent Annual Report:<br /><br />"Hydro and Statoil have, in close cooperation with Norwegian and US authorities, concluded their parallel investigations in order to clarify the facts surrounding payments in connection with Hydro's (now Statoil's) operations in Libya and consultancy agreements relating to Hydro's previous international oil and gas operations in relation to applicable anticorruption regulations. The fact findings of the investigations were submitted and presented to the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Ã˜kokrim) on October 7, 2008, and to the US authorities in November 2008. Neither of these authorities have found reason to open investigations of the matter."
