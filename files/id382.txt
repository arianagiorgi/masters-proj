        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>

        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>

        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Following a whistleblower's allegations of non-compliant financial practices in 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued a formal order to Qualcomm requiring a private investigation. Assisted by outside counsel and independent forensic accountants, the company's audit committee conducted a review of the allegations; the investigation did not identify any errors on the company's financial statements.  <br /><br />On 27 January 2012, the Company was informed that the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") had initiated an investigation of the company's FCPA compliance.  <br /><br />In its 18 July 2012 10-Q filing with the SEC, the Company noted that its audit committee had begun an internal review into the Company’s FCPA compliance, with the assistance of independent counsel.  In connection with the investigation, the Company informed the SEC and the DOJ of "instances in which special hiring consideration, gifts or other benefits ... were provided to several individuals associated with Chinese state-owned companies or agencies. Based on the facts currently known, the Company believes the aggregate monetary value of the benefits in question to be less than $250,000, excluding employment compensation."<br /><br />In the Company's SEC Form 10-K filed on 7 November 2012, the statement about the SEC and DOJ investigation was repeated, but no additional information was given about the jurisdictions, transactions or individuals involved. Likewise, the Company repeated the statement about the internal investigation in its SEC Form 10-Q filed on 24 July 2013. <br /><br />On 23 April 2014, Qualcomm disclosed in its Form 10-Q that it received a Wells notice from the SEC.  The Wells notice indicated that SEC staffers decided to recommend action be taken with regard to alleged FCPA violations related to benefits offered or provided to individuals associated with Chinese state-owned companies or agencies.<br /><br />On 12 August 2014, China's State Council fired one of its senior advisors to the State Council’s Anti-Monopoly Commission after he allegedly provided consulting services to Qualcomm at a time when Qualcomm is facing an antitrust probe in China.  Qualcomm allegedly hired the senior advisor without approval from the State Council and allegedly paid him USD $975,000 for his assistance in providing a report to China’s National Development and Reform Commission ("NDRC") to show that the company didn’t engage in monopolistic practices.  Qualcomm denied paying the advisor directly because the report was allegedly written by Chicago-based Global Economics Group LLC and co-authored by Mr. Zhang, and the fee was paid to Global Economics for its services.
