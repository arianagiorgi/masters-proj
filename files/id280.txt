        Argentina: Federal Criminal Court, City of Buenos Aires<br />
        
        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Accor Services ("Accor Services")<br />Hector Recalde (Argentinian National Deputy)
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>
        Employee fringe benefit management services and assistance to governments in administering aid programs
        
        <h2>CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS</h2>

        Argentina<br />
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        Accor Services, a French company, provided services such as restaurant tickets and food vouchers to businesses and the government in Argentina.  Such services included lunch tickets or vouchers that employers in Argentina informally used to pay part of employees' salary, but which are not formally included for calculations of employees' holidays, sick leave and bonuses.  In 2007, the national legislature in Argentina proposed to formalize the inclusion of the lunch vouchers in salaries (a measure that would likely reduce employers' demand for the vouchers).<br /><br />In November 2007, Argentinian National Deputy, Mr. Recalde, was allegedly approached by a representative of Accor Services with an offer of a bribe in exchange for using his influence on the Lower House Labour Committee to delay a government plan to formalize the inclusion of lunch vouchers in salaries.  Mr. Recalde claimed that the representative offered him a bribe of over USD 20 million.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        In February 2008, the Argentine official who was offered the bribe, Mr. Recalde, brought a complaint in Argentine court and also with the Argentine OECD National Contact Point.*  Recordings of telephone calls and meetings with the Accor Services representative were used as evidence in a domestic legal case as well as the OECD Guidelines specific instance.<br /><br />* The OECD describes the National Contact Points for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises as follows:  "The National Contact Point (NCP) is a government office responsible for encouraging observance of the Guidelines in a national context and for ensuring that the Guidelines are well known and understood by the national business community and by other interested parties. The NCP gathers information on national experiences with the Guidelines, handles enquiries, discusses matters related to the Guidelines and assists in solving problems that may arise in this connection. When issues arise concerning implementation of the Guidelines in relation to specific instances of business conduct, the NCP is expected to help resolve them. Generally, issues are dealt with by the NCP in whose country the issue has arisen. Any person or organisation may approach a National Contact Point to enquire about a matter related to the Guidelines."
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        An Argentine court indicted the President of the Chamber of the Restaurant Tickets industry (Cámara de Empresas de Servicios de Vales) who also used to be a Director of an Accor subsidiary in Argentina, as well as the Argentine middleman who offered the bribes.  It is unclear what came of these proceedings.  Both defendants asked for "diversion" but the Prosecutor, quoting the UNCAC, refused any sort of agreement and asked for trial.  The Court of Cassasion currently reviewing the defendant´s motion. <br /><br />On 27 February 2008, the Argentine NCP accepted the case as a "specific instance."  The NCP forwarded the complaint to Accor Services and invited the company to engage in a NCP-facilitated mediation process.  Accor Services engaged in the process and the matter was successfully concluded with a negotiated agreement in March 2009.  The details of the mediated settlement were not made public, but it is understood Accor Services agreed to make a financial contribution to an Argentinean NGO - Poder Ciudadano (the Argentine chapter of Transparency International) - to support its transparency and anti-corruption program.  The amount of the contribution was USD 60,000, much lower than the complainant's request for a contribution equal to 5% of the bribe offered.  The agreement also included protection for the workers affected by the outcome of the case.
