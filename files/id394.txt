        <h2>ENTITIES/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED</h2>
        Analogic Corporation ("Analogic")<br />BK Medical ("BK"), a Danish subsidiary of Analogic
        
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS</h2>

        <h2>NATIONALITY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS</h2>
        
        
        <h2>SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS</h2>
        In its Annual Report and SEC Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending 31 January 2011, and again it the quarterly report filed on 7 March 2012, Analogic noted that it had  identified transactions involving the company's Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and some of its foreign distributors, which may have violated U.S., Danish and other law as well as the company's business policies.  The Company added that the incidents "have included transactions in which the distributors paid BK Medical amounts in excess of amounts owed and BK Medical transferred the excess amounts, at the direction of the distributors, to third parties identified by the distributors. We have been unable to ascertain with certainty the ultimate beneficiaries or the purpose of these transfers."<br /><br />The company disclosed the findings to the DOJ, the SEC and the Danish Government.

        <h2>HOW CONDUCT WAS DISCOVERED</h2>
        
        
        <h2>ENFORCEMENT RESULT</h2>
        After disclosing the suspect transactions to US and Danish authorities, Analogic terminated employment of BK Medical employees who were involved in the transactions, and began winding down its relationship with BK Medical distributors who were involved.  In its SEC filing, the Company explained, "Revenue from sales to the BK Medical distributors with whom we have decided to wind down BK Medical's relationship, represented less than 1% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2011 and less than 2.5% of our total revenue in the three and six months ended January 31, 2012. During the six months ended January 31, 2012, we incurred employee termination costs of approximately $400 and inquiry-related costs of approximately $1,204 in connection with this matter."
